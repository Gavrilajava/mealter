    - Chicken
    - "The chicken is a type of domesticated fowl, a subspecies of the red junglefowl
      (Gallus gallus). It is one of the most common and widespread domestic animals,
      with a total population of more than 19 billion as of 2011. There are more chickens
      in the world than any other bird or domesticated fowl. Humans keep chickens
      primarily as a source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) and, less
      commonly, as pets. Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies,
      chickens were not kept for food until the Hellenistic period (4th–2nd centuries
      BC).\r\n\r\nGenetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origins in South
      Asia, Southeast Asia, and East Asia, but with the clade found in the Americas,
      Europe, the Middle East and Africa originating in the Indian subcontinent. From
      ancient India, the domesticated chicken spread to Lydia in western Asia Minor,
      and to Greece by the 5th century BC. Fowl had been known in Egypt since the
      mid-15th century BC, with the \"bird that gives birth every day\" having come
      to Egypt from the land between Syria and Shinar, Babylonia, according to the
      annals of Thutmose III."

    - Salmon
    - "Salmon is the common name for several species of ray-finned fish in the family
      Salmonidae. Other fish in the same family include trout, char, grayling and
      whitefish. Salmon are native to tributaries of the North Atlantic (genus Salmo)
      and Pacific Ocean (genus Oncorhynchus). Many species of salmon have been introduced
      into non-native environments such as the Great Lakes of North America and Patagonia
      in South America. Salmon are intensively farmed in many parts of the world.\r\n\r\nTypically,
      salmon are anadromous: they hatch in fresh water, migrate to the ocean, then
      return to fresh water to reproduce. However, populations of several species
      are restricted to fresh water through their lives. Folklore has it that the
      fish return to the exact spot where they hatched to spawn. Tracking studies
      have shown this to be mostly true. A portion of a returning salmon run may stray
      and spawn in different freshwater systems; the percent of straying depends on
      the species of salmon. Homing behavior has been shown to depend on olfactory
      memory. Salmon date back to the Neogene."

    - Beef
    - "Beef is the culinary name for meat from cattle, particularly skeletal muscle.
      Humans have been eating beef since prehistoric times. Beef is a source of high-quality
      protein and nutrients.\r\n\r\nMost beef skeletal muscle meat can be used as
      is by merely cutting into certain parts, such as roasts, short ribs or steak
      (filet mignon, sirloin steak, rump steak, rib steak, rib eye steak, hanger steak,
      etc.), while other cuts are processed (corned beef or beef jerky). Trimmings,
      on the other hand, are usually mixed with meat from older, leaner (therefore
      tougher) cattle, are ground, minced or used in sausages. The blood is used in
      some varieties called blood sausage. Other parts that are eaten include other
      muscles and offal, such as the oxtail, liver, tongue, tripe from the reticulum
      or rumen, glands (particularly the pancreas and thymus, referred to as sweetbread),
      the heart, the brain (although forbidden where there is a danger of bovine spongiform
      encephalopathy, BSE, commonly referred to as mad cow disease), the kidneys,
      and the tender testicles of the bull (known in the United States as calf fries,
      prairie oysters, or Rocky Mountain oysters). Some intestines are cooked and
      eaten as is, but are more often cleaned and used as natural sausage casings.
      The bones are used for making beef stock."

    - Pork
    - "Pork is the culinary name for the flesh of a domestic pig (Sus scrofa domesticus).
      It is the most commonly consumed meat worldwide,[1] with evidence of pig husbandry
      dating back to 5000 BC.\r\n\r\nPork is eaten both freshly cooked and preserved.
      Curing extends the shelf life of the pork products. Ham, smoked pork, gammon,
      bacon and sausage are examples of preserved pork. Charcuterie is the branch
      of cooking devoted to prepared meat products, many from pork.\r\n\r\nPig is
      the most popular meat in the Eastern and non-Muslim parts of Southeastern Asia
      (Indochina, Philippines, Singapore, East Timor) and is also very common in the
      Western world, especially in Central Europe. It is highly prized in Asian cuisines
      for its fat content and pleasant texture. Consumption of pork is forbidden by
      Jewish, Muslim and Rastafarian dietary law, for religious reasons, with several
      suggested possible causes."

    - Avocado
    - "The avocado, a tree with probable origin in South Central Mexico, is classified
      as a member of the flowering plant family Lauraceae. The fruit of the plant,
      also called an avocado (or avocado pear or alligator pear), is botanically a
      large berry containing a single large seed.\r\n\r\nAvocados are commercially
      valuable and are cultivated in tropical and Mediterranean climates throughout
      the world. They have a green-skinned, fleshy body that may be pear-shaped, egg-shaped,
      or spherical. Commercially, they ripen after harvesting. Avocado trees are partially
      self-pollinating, and are often propagated through grafting to maintain predictable
      fruit quality and quantity. In 2017, Mexico produced 34% of the world supply
      of avocados."

    - Apple Cider Vinegar
    - Apple cider vinegar, or cider vinegar, is a vinegar made from fermented apple
      juice, and used in salad dressings, marinades, vinaigrettes, food preservatives,
      and chutneys. It is made by crushing apples, then squeezing out the juice. Bacteria
      and yeast are added to the liquid to start the alcoholic fermentation process,
      which converts the sugars to alcohol. In a second fermentation step, the alcohol
      is converted into vinegar by acetic acid-forming bacteria (Acetobacter species).
      Acetic acid and malic acid combine to give vinegar its sour taste. Apple cider
      vinegar has no medicinal or nutritional value. There is no high-quality clinical
      evidence that regular consumption of apple cider vinegar helps to maintain or
      lose body weight, or is effective to manage blood glucose and lipid levels.

    - Asparagus
    - "Asparagus, or garden asparagus, folk name sparrow grass, scientific name Asparagus
      officinalis, is a perennial flowering plant species in the genus Asparagus.
      Its young shoots are used as a spring vegetable.\r\n\r\nIt was once classified
      in the lily family, like the related Allium species, onions and garlic. However,
      genetic research places lilies, Allium, and asparagus in three separate families—the
      Liliaceae, Amaryllidaceae, and Asparagaceae, respectively—with the Amaryllidaceae
      and Asparagaceae being grouped together in the order Asparagales. Sources differ
      as to the native range of Asparagus officinalis, but generally include most
      of Europe and western temperate Asia. It is widely cultivated as a vegetable
      crop."

    - Aubergine
    - "Eggplant (US, Australia), aubergine (UK), or brinjal (South Asia and South
      Africa) is a plant species in the nightshade family Solanaceae. Solanum melongena
      is grown worldwide for its edible fruit.\r\n\r\nMost commonly purple, the spongy,
      absorbent fruit is used in various cuisines. Although often considered a vegetable,
      it is a berry by botanical definition. As a member of the genus Solanum, it
      is related to tomato and potato. Like the tomato, its skin and seeds can be
      eaten, but, like the potato, it is usually eaten cooked. Eggplant is nutritionally
      low in macronutrient and micronutrient content, but the capability of the fruit
      to absorb oils and flavors into its flesh through cooking expands its use in
      the culinary arts.\r\n\r\nIt was originally domesticated from the wild nightshade
      species thorn or bitter apple, S. incanum, probably with two independent domestications:
      one in South Asia, and one in East Asia."

    - Baby Plum Tomatoes
    - The tomato is the edible, often red, berry of the plant Solanum lycopersicum,
      commonly known as a tomato plant. The species originated in western South America
      and Central America. The Nahuatl (Aztec language) word tomatl gave rise to the
      Spanish word tomate, from which the English word tomato derived.[3][4] Its domestication
      and use as a cultivated food may have originated with the indigenous peoples
      of Mexico. The Aztecs used tomatoes in their cooking at the time of the Spanish
      conquest of the Aztec Empire, and after the Spanish encountered the tomato for
      the first time after their contact with the Aztecs, they brought the plant to
      Europe. From there, the tomato was introduced to other parts of the European-colonized
      world during the 16th century.

    - Bacon is a type of salt-cured pork. Bacon is prepared from several different
      cuts of meat, typically from the pork belly or from back cuts, which have less
      fat than the belly. It is eaten on its own, as a side dish (particularly in
      breakfasts), or used as a minor ingredient to flavour dishes (e.g., the club
      sandwich). Bacon is also used for barding and larding roasts, especially game,
      including venison and pheasant. The word is derived from the Old High German
      bacho, meaning "buttock", "ham" or "side of bacon", and is cognate with the
      Old French bacon.

    - Baking Powder
    - Baking powder is a dry chemical leavening agent, a mixture of a carbonate or
      bicarbonate and a weak acid. The base and acid are prevented from reacting prematurely
      by the inclusion of a buffer such as cornstarch. Baking powder is used to increase
      the volume and lighten the texture of baked goods. It works by releasing carbon
      dioxide gas into a batter or dough through an acid-base reaction, causing bubbles
      in the wet mixture to expand and thus leavening the mixture. The first single-acting
      baking powder was developed by Birmingham based food manufacturer Alfred Bird
      in England in 1843. The first double-acting baking powder was developed by Eben
      Norton Horsford in America in the 1860s.

    - Basmati Rice
    - Basmati is a variety of long, slender-grained aromatic rice which is traditionally
      from the Indian subcontinent. As of 2018-19, India exported to over 90% of the
      overseas basmati rice market, while Pakistan accounted for the remainder, according
      to the Indian state-run Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development
      Authority  and the Pakistan government-run Economic Survey of Pakistan. Many
      countries use domestically grown basmati rice crops; however, basmati is geographically
      exclusive to select districts of India, Pakistan, Nepal and Bangladesh.

    - Bicarbonate Of Soda
    - Sodium bicarbonate, commonly known as baking soda, is a chemical compound with
      the formula NaHCO3. It is a salt composed of a sodium cation (Na+) and a bicarbonate
      anion (HCO3−). Sodium bicarbonate is a white solid that is crystalline, but
      often appears as a fine powder. It has a slightly salty, alkaline taste resembling
      that of washing soda (sodium carbonate). The natural mineral form is nahcolite.
      It is a component of the mineral natron and is found dissolved in many mineral
      springs.

      dish with its origins among the Muslims of the Indian subcontinent. It can be
      compared to mixing a curry, later combining it with semi-cooked rice separately.
      This dish is especially popular throughout the Indian subcontinent, as well
      as among the diaspora from the region. It is also prepared in other regions
      such as Iraqi Kurdistan. It is made with Indian spices, rice, meat (chicken,
      goat, beef, lamb, prawn, or fish), vegetables or eggs.

    - Black Pepper
    - "Black pepper (Piper nigrum) is a flowering vine in the family Piperaceae, cultivated
      for its fruit, known as a peppercorn, which is usually dried and used as a spice
      and seasoning. When fresh and fully mature, it is about 5 mm (0.20 in) in diameter
      and dark red, and contains a single seed, like all drupes. Peppercorns and the
      ground pepper derived from them may be described simply as pepper, or more precisely
      as black pepper (cooked and dried unripe fruit), green pepper (dried unripe
      fruit), or white pepper (ripe fruit seeds).\r\n\r\nBlack pepper is native to
      present-day Kerala in Southwestern India, and is extensively cultivated there
      and elsewhere in tropical regions. Vietnam is the world's largest producer and
      exporter of pepper, producing 34% of the world's crop, as of 2013."

    - Baby Aubergine
    - "Eggplant (Solanum melongena) or aubergine is a species of nightshade grown
      for its edible fruit. Eggplant is the common name in North America, Australia
      and New Zealand; in British English, it is aubergine, and in South Asia and
      South Africa, brinjal.\r\n\r\nThe fruit is widely used in cooking. As a member
      of the genus Solanum, it is related to the tomato and the potato. It was originally
      domesticated from the wild nightshade species, the thorn or bitter apple, S.
      incanum, probably with two independent domestications, one in South Asia and
      one in East Asia."

    - Paella Rice
    - "Paella[a] is a Valencian rice dish that has ancient roots but its modern form
      originated in the mid-19th century in the area around Albufera lagoon on the
      east coast of Spain, adjacent to the city of Valencia. Many non-Spaniards view
      paella as Spain's national dish, but most Spaniards consider it to be a regional
      Valencian dish. Valencians, in turn, regard paella as one of their identifying
      symbols.\r\n\r\nTypes of paella include Valencian paella, vegetable paella (Spanish:
      paella de verduras), seafood paella (Spanish: paella de mariscos), and mixed
      paella (Spanish: paella mixta), among many others. Valencian paella is believed
      to be the original recipe and consists of white rice, green beans (bajoqueta
      and tavella), meat (chicken, duck and rabbit), white beans (garrofón), snails,
      and seasoning such as saffron and rosemary. Another very common but seasonal
      ingredient is artichokes. Seafood paella replaces meat with seafood and omits
      beans and green vegetables. Mixed paella is a free-style combination of meat
      from land animals, seafood, vegetables, and sometimes beans. Most paella chefs
      use bomba rice due to it being less likely to overcook, but Valencians tend
      to use a slightly stickier (and thus more susceptible to overcooking) variety
      known as Senia. All types of paellas use olive oil."

    - Scotch Bonnet
    - "Scotch bonnet, also known as bonney peppers, or Caribbean red peppers, is a
      variety of chili pepper named for its resemblance to a tam o' shanter hat. Also
      called ata rodo by Yoruba speakers of Nigeria, it is found mainly in the Caribbean
      islands; it is also found in Guyana (where it is called the ball-of-fire pepper),
      the Maldives Islands (where it is called githeyo mirus), Panama (where it is
      called aji chombo) and West Africa. Most Scotch bonnets have a heat rating of
      100,000–350,000 Scoville units. For comparison, most jalapeño peppers have a
      heat rating of 2,500 to 8,000 on the Scoville scale. However, completely sweet
      varieties of Scotch bonnet are grown on some of the Caribbean islands, called
      cachucha peppers.\r\n\r\nThese peppers are used to flavour many different dishes
      and cuisines worldwide and are often used in hot sauces and condiments. The
      Scotch bonnet has a sweeter flavour and stouter shape, distinct from its habanero
      relative with which it is often confused, and gives jerk dishes (pork/chicken)
      and other Caribbean dishes their unique flavour. Scotch bonnets are mostly used
      in West African, Antiguan, Kittitian/Nevisian, Anguilan, Dominican, St. Lucian,
      St Vincentian, Grenadian, Trinidadian, Jamaican, Barbadian, Guyanese, Surinamese,
      Haitian and Cayman cuisines and pepper sauces, though they often show up in
      other Caribbean recipes. It is also used in Costa Rica and Panama for Caribbean-styled
      recipes such as rice and beans, Rondón, saus, beef patties, and Ceviche.\r\n\r\nFresh,
      ripe Scotch bonnets can change from green to yellow to scarlet red, however
      many other breeds of this pepper can ripen to orange, yellow, peach, or even
      a chocolate brown."

    - Oxtail
    - "Oxtail (occasionally spelled ox tail or ox-tail) is the culinary name for the
      tail of cattle. Formerly, it referred only to the tail of an ox or steer, a
      bullock (a castrated male).[citation needed] An oxtail typically weighs 2 to
      4 lbs. (1–1.8 kg) and is skinned and cut into short lengths for sale.\r\n\r\nOxtail
      is a bony, gelatin-rich meat, which is usually slow-cooked as a stew[1] or braised.
      It is a traditional stock base for a soup. Traditional preparations involve
      slow cooking, so some modern recipes take a shortcut using a pressure cooker.
      Oxtail is the main ingredient of the Italian dish coda alla vaccinara (a classic
      of Roman cuisine). It is a popular flavour for powder, instant and premade canned
      soups in the United Kingdom and Ireland. Oxtails are also one of the popular
      bases for Russian aspic appetizer dishes (холодец or студень), along with pig
      trotters or ears or cow \"knees\", but are the preferred ingredients among Russian
      Jews because they can be Kosher.\r\n\r\nVersions of oxtail soup are popular
      traditional dishes in South America, West Africa, China, Spain [2] and Indonesia.
      In Chinese cuisine, it's usually made into a soup called 牛尾汤 (niúwěi tāng, \"oxtail
      soup\"). In Korean cuisine, a soup made with oxtail is called kkori gomtang
      (see gomguk). It is a thick soup seasoned with salt and eaten with a bowl of
      rice. It can be used as a stock for making tteokguk (rice cake soup). Stewed
      oxtail with butter bean or as main dish (with rice) is popular in Jamaica, Trinidad,
      and other West Indian cultures. Oxtail is also very popular in South Africa
      where it is often cooked in a traditional skillet called a potjie, which is
      a three-legged cast iron pot placed over an open fire. Oxtail is also eaten
      in other southern parts of Africa like Zimbabwe and served with sadza and greens.
      In the United States, oxtail is a mainstay in African American and West Indian
      households. In Cuban cuisine, a stew can be made from oxtail called rabo encendido.
      In the Philippines, it is prepared in a peanut based stew called Kare-kare.
      In Iran, Oxtail is slow-cooked and served as a substitute for shank in a main
      dish called Baghla-Poli-Mahicheh which is prepared with rice, shank (or oxtail)
      and a mixture of herbs including dill, coriander, parsley and garlic.\r\n\r\nIn
      the United States, oxtail has the meat-cutting classification NAMP 1791."

    - Red Snapper
    - "The northern red snapper (Lutjanus campechanus) is a species of snapper native
      to the western Atlantic Ocean including the Gulf of Mexico, where it inhabits
      environments associated with reefs. This species is commercially important and
      is also sought-after as a game fish.\r\n\r\nThe northern red snapper's body
      is very similar in shape to other snappers, such as the mangrove snapper, mutton
      snapper, lane snapper, and dog snapper. All feature a sloped profile, medium-to-large
      scales, a spiny dorsal fin, and a laterally compressed body. Northern red snapper
      have short, sharp, needle-like teeth, but they lack the prominent upper canine
      teeth found on the mutton, dog, and mangrove snappers. This snapper reaches
      maturity at a length of about 39 cm (15 in). The common adult length is 60 cm
      (24 in), but may reach 100 cm (39 in). The maximum published weight is 38 kg
      (84 lb), and the oldest reported age is 100+ years. Coloration of the northern
      red snapper is light red, with more intense pigment on the back. It has 10 dorsal
      spines, 14 soft dorsal rays, three anal spines and eight to 9 anal soft rays.
      Juvenile fish (shorter than 30–35 cm) can also have a dark spot on their sides,
      below the anterior soft dorsal rays, which fades with age."

    - Malt Vinegar
    - "Vinegar is a liquid consisting of about 5–20% acetic acid (CH3COOH), water,
      and other trace chemicals, which may include flavorings. The acetic acid is
      produced by the fermentation of ethanol by acetic acid bacteria. Vinegar is
      now mainly used as a cooking ingredient, or in pickling. As the most easily
      manufactured mild acid, it has historically had a great variety of industrial,
      medical, and domestic uses, some of which (such as its use as a general household
      cleaner) are still commonly practiced today.\r\n\r\nCommercial vinegar is produced
      either by a fast or a slow fermentation process. In general, slow methods are
      used in traditional vinegars where fermentation proceeds slowly over the course
      of a few months or up to a year. The longer fermentation period allows for the
      accumulation of a non-toxic slime composed of acetic acid bacteria. Fast methods
      add mother of vinegar (bacterial culture) to the source liquid before adding
      air to oxygenate and promote the fastest fermentation. In fast production processes,
      vinegar may be produced between 20 hours to three days."

    - Rice Vinegar
    - "Rice vinegar is a vinegar made from fermented rice in China, Japan, Korea,
      and Vietnam.\r\n\r\nChinese rice vinegars are stronger than Japanese ones, and
      range in colour from clear to various shades of red, brown and black and are
      therefore known as rice wine vinegar. Chinese and especially Japanese vinegars
      are less acidic than the distilled Western vinegars which, for that reason,
      are not appropriate substitutes for rice vinegars. The majority of the Asian
      rice vinegar types are also more mild and sweet than vinegars typically used
      in the Western world, with black vinegars as a notable exception. Chinese rice
      vinegars are made from huangjiu, a type of rice wine."

    - Water Chestnut
    - "Eleocharis dulcis, the Chinese water chestnut or water chestnut, is a grass-like
      sedge native to Asia (China, Japan, India, Philippines, etc.), Australia, tropical
      Africa, and various islands of the Pacific and Indian Oceans. It is grown in
      many countries for its edible corms.\r\n\r\nThe water chestnut is not a nut
      at all, but an aquatic vegetable that grows in marshes, under water, in the
      mud. It has stem-like, tubular green leaves that grow to about 1.5 m. The water
      caltrop, which also is referred to by the same name, is unrelated and often
      confused with the water chestnut.\r\n\r\nThe small, rounded corms have a crisp,
      white flesh and may be eaten raw, slightly boiled, or grilled, and often are
      pickled or tinned. They are a popular ingredient in Chinese dishes. In China,
      they are most often eaten raw, sometimes sweetened. They also may be ground
      into a flour form used for making water chestnut cake, which is common as part
      of dim sum cuisine. They are unusual among vegetables for remaining crisp even
      after being cooked or canned, because their cell walls are cross-linked and
      strengthened by certain phenolic compounds, such as oligomers of ferulic acid.
      This property is shared by other vegetables that remain crisp in this manner,
      including the tiger nut and lotus root. The corms contain the antibiotic agent
      puchiin, which is stable to high temperature. Apart from the edible corms, the
      leaves can be used for cattlefeed, mulch or compost.\r\n\r\nThe corms are rich
      in carbohydrates (about 90% by dry weight), especially starch (about 60% by
      dry weight), and are also a good source of dietary fiber, riboflavin, vitamin
      B6, potassium, copper, and manganese.\r\n\r\nIf eaten uncooked, the surface
      of the plants may transmit fasciolopsiasis."

    - Tofu
    - "Tofu, also known as bean curd, is a food cultivated by coagulating soy milk
      and then pressing the resulting curds into soft white blocks. It is a component
      in East Asian and Southeast Asian cuisines. Tofu can be soft, firm, or extra
      firm. Tofu has a subtle flavor and can be used in savory and sweet dishes. It
      is often seasoned or marinated to suit the dish.\r\n\r\nTofu has a low calorie
      count and relatively large amounts of protein. It is high in iron, and it can
      have a high calcium or magnesium content, depending on the coagulants used in
      manufacturing (e.g. calcium chloride, calcium sulfate, magnesium sulfate)."

    - Doubanjiang
    - "Doubanjiang (IPA: [tôupântɕjâŋ]), or simply Douban, or Toban-djan, Chili
      bean sauce, is a spicy, salty paste made from fermented broad beans, soybeans,
      salt, rice, and various spices. Doubanjiang exists in plain and spicy versions,
      with the latter containing red chili peppers and called la doubanjiang (辣豆瓣酱;
      pinyin: là dòubànjiàng; là meaning \"hot\" or \"spicy\").\r\n\r\nIt is used
      particularly in Sichuan cuisine, and in fact, the people of the province commonly
      refer to it as \"the soul of Sichuan cuisine\". A particularly well-known variety
      is called Pixian Douban (simplified Chinese: 郫县豆瓣; traditional Chinese: 郫縣豆瓣;
      pinyin: Píxiàn dòubàn), named after the district of Pixian, Sichuan.[1]\r\n\r\nThis
      sauce is sometimes stir-fried with oil and eaten with rice or noodles as a quick
      meal, and is also commonly used as a primary flavoring for fried tofu dishes
      and cold tofu salads. It is also frequently mixed with instant noodles.\r\n\r\nIn
      many Chinese communities and food factories, doubanjiang is produced with only
      soybeans and salt, and does not contain the broad beans or chili peppers typical
      of Sichuan-style doubanjiang.\r\n\r\nIn Korean cuisine, a similar form of bean
      paste is called doenjang."

    - Fermented Black Beans
    - "Douchi (Chinese: 豆豉; pinyin: dòuchǐ), or tochi is a type of fermented and salted
      black soybean. In English, it is known as fermented black soybeans, Chinese
      fermented black beans (Chinese: 黑豆豆豉; pinyin: hēidòu dòuchǐ), salted black beans,
      salty black beans, or just black beans. They are a flavoring most popular in
      the cuisine of China, where they are most widely used for making black bean
      sauce dishes.[1][page needed]\r\n\r\nDouchi is made by fermenting and salting
      black soybeans. The black type soybean is most commonly used and the process
      turns the beans soft, and mostly semi-dry (if the beans are allowed to dry).
      Regular soybeans (white soybeans) are also used, but this does not produce \"salted
      black beans\"; instead, these beans become brown. The smell is sharp, pungent,
      and spicy; the taste is salty, somewhat bitter and sweet.[citation needed] The
      product made with white soybeans is called mianchi.\r\n\r\nThe process and product
      are similar to ogiri and iru, both being African fermented bean products[citation
      needed].\r\n\r\nDouchi, \"Chinese salted black beans\", and \"black soybeans\"
      should not be confused with the black turtle bean, a variety of common bean
      that is commonly used in the cuisines of Central America, South America, and
      the Caribbean."

    - Scallions
    - "Scallions (green onion, spring onion and salad onion) are vegetables of various
      Allium onion species. Scallions have a milder taste than most onions. Their
      close relatives include the garlic, shallot, leek, chive, and Chinese onion.\r\n\r\nAlthough
      the bulbs of many Allium species are used as food, the defining characteristic
      of scallion species is that they lack a fully developed bulb. In common with
      all Allium species, scallions have hollow, tubular green leaves, growing directly
      from the bulb. These leaves are used as a vegetable; they are eaten either raw
      or cooked. The leaves are often chopped into other dishes, in the manner of
      onions or garlic. Also known as scallions or green onions, spring onions are
      in fact very young onions, harvested before the bulb has had a chance to swell."

    - Sichuan Pepper
    - "Sichuan pepper, Sichuan peppercorn, or Szechuan pepper, is a commonly used
      spice in Chinese cuisine. It is derived from at least two species of the global
      genus Zanthoxylum, including Z. simulans and Z. bungeanum. The genus Zanthoxylum
      belongs in the rue or citrus family, and, despite its name, is not closely related
      to either black pepper nor the chili pepper.\r\n\r\nThe husk or hull (pericarp)
      around the seeds may be used whole, especially in Sichuan cuisine, and the finely
      ground powder is one of the ingredients for five-spice powder. It is also used
      in traditional Chinese medicine. The pericarp is most often used, but the leaves
      of various species are also used in some regions of China.\r\n\r\nAnother species
      of Zanthoxylum native to China, Z. schinifolium, called xiāng jiāo zi (香椒子,
      \"aromatic peppercorn\") or qīng huā jiāo (青花椒, \"green flower pepper\"), is
      used as a spice in Hebei.\r\n\r\nWhile the exact flavour and composition of
      different species from the genus Zanthoxylum vary, most share the same essential
      characteristics. So while the terms \"Sichuan pepper\" and sanshō may refer
      specifically to Z. simulans and Z. piperitum, respectively, the two are commonly
      used interchangeably.\r\n\r\nRelated species are used in the cuisines of Tibet,
      Bhutan, Nepal, Thailand, and India (the Konkani and Uttarakhandi people) and
      Toba Batak peoples. In Bhutan, this pepper is known as thingye and is used liberally
      in preparation of soups, gruels, and phaag sha paa (pork slices).[citation needed]
      In Nepal, timur is used in the popular foods momo, thukpa, chow mein, chicken
      chilli, and other meat dishes. It is also widely used in homemade pickles. People
      take timur as a medicine for stomach or digestion problems, in a preparation
      with cloves of garlic and mountain salt with warm water."

    - Starch
    - "Starch or amylum is a polymeric carbohydrate consisting of a large number of
      glucose units joined by glycosidic bonds. This polysaccharide is produced by
      most green plants as energy storage. It is the most common carbohydrate in human
      diets and is contained in large amounts in staple foods like potatoes, wheat,
      maize (corn), rice, and cassava.\r\n\r\nPure starch is a white, tasteless and
      odorless powder that is insoluble in cold water or alcohol. It consists of two
      types of molecules: the linear and helical amylose and the branched amylopectin.
      Depending on the plant, starch generally contains 20 to 25% amylose and 75 to
      80% amylopectin by weight.[4] Glycogen, the glucose store of animals, is a more
      highly branched version of amylopectin.\r\n\r\nIn industry, starch is converted
      into sugars, for example by malting, and fermented to produce ethanol in the
      manufacture of beer, whisky and biofuel. It is processed to produce many of
      the sugars used in processed foods. Mixing most starches in warm water produces
      a paste, such as wheatpaste, which can be used as a thickening, stiffening or
      gluing agent. The biggest industrial non-food use of starch is as an adhesive
      in the papermaking process. Starch can be applied to parts of some garments
      before ironing, to stiffen them."

      the fermentation of rice starch that has been converted to sugars. Microbes
      are the source of the enzymes that convert the starches to sugar.[1]\r\n\r\nRice
      wine typically has an alcohol content of 18–25% ABV. Rice wines are used in
      Asian gastronomy at formal dinners and banquets and in cooking. They are also

      shapes. While long, thin strips may be the most common, many varieties of noodles
      are cut into waves, helices, tubes, strings, or shells, or folded over, or cut
      into other shapes. Noodles are usually cooked in boiling water, sometimes with
      cooking oil or salt added. They are often pan-fried or deep-fried. Noodles are
      often served with an accompanying sauce or in a soup. Noodles can be refrigerated
      for short-term storage or dried and stored for future use. The material composition
      or geocultural origin must be specified when discussing noodles. The word derives
      from the German word Nudel.[1]

    - Wood Ear Mushrooms
    - "Auricularia auricula-judae, known as the Jew's ear, wood ear, jelly ear or
      by a number of other common names, is a species of edible Auriculariales fungus
      found worldwide. The fruiting body is distinguished by its noticeably ear-like
      shape and brown colouration; it grows upon wood, especially elder. Its specific
      epithet is derived from the belief that Judas Iscariot hanged himself from an
      elder tree; the common name \"Judas's ear\" was largely eclipsed by the corruption
      \"Jew's ear\", while today \"jelly ear\" and other names are sometimes used.
      The fungus can be found throughout the year in temperate regions worldwide,
      where it grows upon both dead and living wood.\r\n\r\nIn the West, A. auricula-judae
      was used in folk medicine as recently as the 19th century for complaints including
      sore throats, sore eyes and jaundice, and as an astringent. Although it is not
      widely consumed in the West, it has long been popular in China, to the extent
      that Australia exported large volumes to China in the early twentieth century.
      Today, the fungus is a popular ingredient in many Chinese dishes, such as hot
      and sour soup, and also used in Chinese medicine. It is also used in Ghana,
      as a blood tonic. Modern research into possible medical applications has variously
      concluded that A. auricula-judae has antitumour, hypoglycemic, anticoagulant
      and cholesterol-lowering properties."

      The Maritimes and Newfoundland. This drink has famous associations with the
      Royal Navy (where it was mixed with water or beer to make grog) and piracy (where
      it was consumed as bumbo). Rum has also served as a popular medium of economic
      exchange, used to help fund enterprises such as slavery (see Triangular trade),

    - Rum
    - "Rum is a distilled alcoholic drink made from sugarcane byproducts, such as
      molasses, or directly from sugarcane juice, by a process of fermentation and
      distillation. The distillate, a clear liquid, is then usually aged in oak barrels.\r\n\r\nThe
      majority of the world's rum production occurs in the Caribbean and Latin America.
      Rum is also produced in Australia, Portugal, Austria, Canada, Fiji, India, Japan,
      Mauritius, Nepal, New Zealand, the Philippines, Reunion Island, South Africa,
      Spain, Sweden, Taiwan, Thailand, the United Kingdom and the United States.\r\n\r\nRums
      are produced in various grades. Light rums are commonly used in cocktails, whereas
      \"golden\" and \"dark\" rums were typically consumed straight or neat, on the
      rocks, or used for cooking, but are now commonly consumed with mixers. Premium
      rums are also available, made to be consumed either straight or iced.\r\n\r\nRum

    - English Muffins
    - "English muffins are a small, round, flat yeast-leavened bread which is commonly
      sliced horizontally, toasted, and buttered.[2] Toasted English muffins, which
      are often used in the United States as a breakfast food, may be served with
      sweet toppings (e.g., fruit jam, or honey) or savoury toppings (e.g., eggs,
      sausage rounds, bacon, or cheese). English muffins are also used as the bread
      in a variety of breakfast sandwiches, and are an essential ingredient in Eggs
      Benedict and most of its variations.\r\n\r\nIn the United States and U.S.-influenced
      territories, they are called English muffins to distinguish them from U.S. muffins,
      which are larger and sweeter miniature baked quick breads. They are very similar
      to bolo do caco in Portuguese cuisine."

    - Muffins
    - A muffin is an individual-sized, baked product. It can refer to two distinct
      items, a part-raised flatbread and a cupcake-like quickbread. The flatbread
      is of British or European derivation, and dates from at least the early 18th
      century, while the quickbread originated in North America during the 19th century.
      Both are common worldwide today.

    - Wine vinegar is made from red or white wine, and is the most commonly used vinegar
      in Southern and Central Europe, Cyprus and Israel. As with wine, there is a
      considerable range in quality. Better-quality wine vinegars are matured in wood
      for up to two years, and exhibit a complex, mellow flavor. Wine vinegar tends
      to have a lower acidity than white or cider vinegars. More expensive wine vinegars
      are made from individual varieties of wine, such as champagne, sherry, or pinot
      gris.

    - Mars Bar
    - Mars is a variety of chocolate bar produced by Mars, Incorporated. It was first
      manufactured in 1932 in Slough, England by Forrest Mars, Sr. The bar was sold
      in two different formulations. In its original British version the bar consists
      of milk chocolate surrounding caramel and nougat, developed to resemble the
      American candy bar known as the Milky Way, which had been introduced a decade
      earlier. An American version of the Mars Bar was produced which had nougat and
      toasted almonds covered in milk chocolate; later, caramel was added to the recipe
      as well. The American version was discontinued in 2002, though it has been revived
      for short runs since then.

    - "Rice Krispies (also known as Rice Bubbles in Australia and New Zealand) is
      a breakfast cereal marketed by Kellogg's in 1927 and released to the public
      in 1928. Rice Krispies are made of crisped rice (rice and sugar paste that is
      formed into rice shapes or \"berries\", cooked, dried and toasted), and expand
      forming very thin and hollowed out walls that are crunchy and crisp. When milk
      is added to the cereal the walls tend to collapse, creating the \"Snap, crackle
      and pop\" sounds.\r\n\r\nRice Krispies cereal has a long advertising history,
      with the elf cartoon characters Snap, Crackle and Pop touting the brand. In
      1963, The Rolling Stones recorded a short song for a Rice Krispies television
      advertisement."

    - Almond Extract
    - "The almond (Prunus dulcis, syn. Prunus amygdalus) is a species of tree native
      to Mediterranean climate regions of the Middle East, but widely cultivated elsewhere.
      The almond is also the name of the edible and widely cultivated seed of this
      tree. Within the genus Prunus, it is classified with the peach in the subgenus
      Amygdalus, distinguished from the other subgenera by corrugations on the shell
      (endocarp) surrounding the seed.\r\n\r\nThe fruit of the almond is a drupe,
      consisting of an outer hull and a hard shell with the seed, which is not a true
      nut, inside. Shelling almonds refers to removing the shell to reveal the seed.
      Almonds are sold shelled or unshelled. Blanched almonds are shelled almonds
      that have been treated with hot water to soften the seedcoat, which is then
      removed to reveal the white embryo."

    - Goat Meat
    - The domestic goat or simply goat (Capra aegagrus hircus) is a subspecies of
      C. aegagrus domesticated from the wild goat of Southwest Asia and Eastern Europe.
      The goat is a member of the animal family Bovidae and the goat—antelope subfamily
      Caprinae, meaning it is closely related to the sheep. There are over 300 distinct
      breeds of goat. Goats are one of the oldest domesticated species of animal,
      and have been used for milk, meat, fur, and skins across much of the world.
      Milk from goats is often turned into goat cheese.

    - Black Beans
    - The black turtle bean is a small, shiny variety of the common bean (Phaseolus
      vulgaris) especially popular in Latin American cuisine, though it can also be
      found in the Cajun and Creole cuisines of south Louisiana. Like most common
      beans, it is native to the Americas, but has been introduced around the world.
      It is also used in East Indian cooking, Punjabi cuisine, and in Maharashtrian
      cuisine, it is known as Kala Ghevada. It is used interchangeably with vigna
      mungo (black gram) in countries such as the United States. The black turtle
      bean is often simply called the black bean (frijoles negros, zaragoza, judía
      negra, poroto negro, or caraota o habichuela negra in Spanish; and feijão preto
      in Portuguese), although this terminology can cause confusion with other black
      beans.

    - Anchovy Fillet
    - Anchovies are tiny, silvery fish that come from the Mediterranean and southern
      European coasts. They're sold salt-cured, usually oil-packed, and filleted.
      Commonly they come either flat or rolled in cans or jars, or ground and mixed
      with oil or butter to make a paste that is sold in tubes. On their own, anchovies
      are very salty but mixed into sauces, dressings, or pastas they add a wonderful
      depth of flavor.

    - Ras el hanout
    - "Ras el hanout or rass el hanout (Arabic: راس الحانوت‎ raʾs al-ḥānūt, pronounced
      [rɑʔs ælħɑːnuːt] (About this soundlisten)) is a spice mix found in varying forms
      in Tunisia, Algeria, and Morocco.[1] It plays a similar role in North African
      cuisine as garam masala does in Indian cuisine. The name in Arabic means \"head
      of the shop\" and implies a mixture of the best spices the seller has to offer.
      Ras el hanout is used in many savory dishes, sometimes rubbed on meat or fish,
      or stirred into couscous or rice.\r\n\r\nThere is no definitive composition
      of spices that makes up ras el hanout. Each shop, company, or family may have
      their own blend. The mixture usually consists of over a dozen spices, in different
      proportions. Commonly used ingredients include cardamom, cumin, clove, cinnamon,
      nutmeg, mace, allspice, dry ginger, chili peppers, coriander seed, peppercorn,
      sweet and hot paprika, fenugreek, and dry turmeric. Some spices may be particular
      to the region, such as ash berries, chufa, grains of paradise, orris root, monk's
      pepper, cubebs, dried rosebud, fennel seed or aniseed, galangal, long pepper.
      Ingredients may be toasted before being ground or pounded in a mortar and mixed
      together. Some preparations include salt or sugar, but that is generally not
      the accepted practice. Garlic, saffron, nuts or dry herbs are generally not
      included, as they are usually added to dishes individually, but some commercial
      preparations, particularly in Europe and North America, may contain them.\r\n\r\nThe
      composition of ras el hanout differs somewhat from the Baharat spice mix, but
      they differ more by the types of dishes they are associated with and by region
      rather than the ingredients in them. Although used by Berber people, it should
      not be confused with \"berbere\" spice mix from Ethiopia.\r\n\r\nCertain supposed
      aphrodisiacs, including the notoriously dangerous \"green metallic beetles\",
      cantharides, have appeared in many Moroccan prescriptions, but these seem to
      be irrelevant for flavouring purposes."

    - Orange Blossom Water
    - "Orange flower water, or orange blossom water, is the clear, perfumed by-product
      of the distillation of fresh bitter-orange blossoms for their essential oil.\r\n\r\nUses\r\nMediterranean
      Relief.jpg\r\nThis essential water has traditionally been used as an aromatizer
      in many Mediterranean traditional dessert dishes, such as in France for the
      gibassier and pompe à l'huile or in Spain for the Roscón de Reyes (King cake),
      or the Samsa in Tunisia or in Moroccan coffee, but has more recently found its
      way into other cuisines. For example, orange flower water is used in Europe
      to flavor madeleines, in Mexico to flavor little wedding cakes and Pan de muerto,
      and in the United States to make orange blossom scones and marshmallows. Orange
      flower water is also used as an ingredient in some cocktails, such as the Ramos
      Gin Fizz. In Malta and many North African as well as Middle Eastern countries,
      orange blossom water is widely used as medicine for stomach ache and given to
      small children as well as adults.\r\n\r\nOrange flower water has been a traditional
      ingredient used often in North African as well as in Middle Eastern cooking.
      In Arab variants of baklava, orange blossom water is often mixed with the sweet
      syrup for flavor. Orange blossoms are believed to be used in this manner because
      they are seen as the traditional bridal flower and, therefore, symbolize purity
      (white, small and delicate). It is also added to plain water in the Middle East
      to mask high mineral content and other unpleasant flavors (e.g. those arising
      from storage in a qulla, a type of clay jug that keeps water cool in a manner
      similar to the zeer); some add the fragrance irrespective of the taste of the
      plain water."

    - Warm Water
    - Water is an inorganic, transparent, tasteless, odorless, and nearly colorless
      chemical substance, which is the main constituent of Earth's hydrosphere and
      the fluids of most living organisms. It is vital for all known forms of life,
      even though it provides no calories or organic nutrients. Its chemical formula
      is H2O, meaning that each of its molecules contains one oxygen and two hydrogen
      atoms, connected by covalent bonds. Water is the name of the liquid state of
      H2O at standard ambient temperature and pressure. It forms precipitation in
      the form of rain and aerosols in the form of fog. Clouds are formed from suspended
      droplets of water and ice, its solid state. When finely divided, crystalline
      ice may precipitate in the form of snow. The gaseous state of water is steam
      or water vapor. Water moves continually through the water cycle of evaporation,
      transpiration (evapotranspiration), condensation, precipitation, and runoff,
      usually reaching the sea.

    - Apple Frangipan Tart
    - Dessert
    - British
    - "Preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6.\r\nPut the biscuits in a large re-sealable
      freezer bag and bash with a rolling pin into fine crumbs. Melt the butter in
      a small pan, then add the biscuit crumbs and stir until coated with butter.
      Tip into the tart tin and, using the back of a spoon, press over the base and
      sides of the tin to give an even layer. Chill in the fridge while you make the
      filling.\r\nCream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. You
      can do this in a food processor if you have one. Process for 2-3 minutes. Mix
      in the eggs, then add the ground almonds and almond extract and blend until
      well combined.\r\nPeel the apples, and cut thin slices of apple. Do this at
      the last minute to prevent the apple going brown. Arrange the slices over the
      biscuit base. Spread the frangipane filling evenly on top. Level the surface
      and sprinkle with the flaked almonds.\r\nBake for 20-25 minutes until golden-brown
      and set.\r\nRemove from the oven and leave to cool for 15 minutes. Remove the
      sides of the tin. An easy way to do this is to stand the tin on a can of beans
      and push down gently on the edges of the tin.\r\nTransfer the tart, with the
      tin base attached, to a serving plate. Serve warm with cream, crème fraiche
      or ice cream."

    - Apple & Blackberry Crumble
    - Dessert
    - British
    - "Heat oven to 190C/170C fan/gas 5. Tip the flour and sugar into a large bowl.
      Add the butter, then rub into the flour using your fingertips to make a light
      breadcrumb texture. Do not overwork it or the crumble will become heavy. Sprinkle
      the mixture evenly over a baking sheet and bake for 15 minutes or until lightly
      coloured.\r\nMeanwhile, for the compote, peel, core and cut the apples into
      2cm dice. Put the butter and sugar in a medium saucepan and melt together over
      a medium heat. Cook for 3 minutes until the mixture turns to a light caramel.
      Stir in the apples and cook for 3 mins. Add the blackberries and cinnamon, and
      cook for 3 minutes more. Cover, remove from the heat, then leave for 2-3 minutes
      to continue cooking in the warmth of the pan.\r\nTo serve, spoon the warm fruit
      into an ovenproof gratin dish, top with the crumble mix, then reheat in the
      oven for 5-10 mins. Serve with vanilla ice cream."

    - Bakewell tart
    - Dessert
    - British
    - "To make the pastry, measure the flour into a bowl and rub in the butter with
      your fingertips until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs. Add the water,
      mixing to form a soft dough.\r\nRoll out the dough on a lightly floured work
      surface and use to line a 20cm/8in flan tin. Leave in the fridge to chill for
      30 minutes.\r\nPreheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6 (180C fan).\r\nLine the pastry
      case with foil and fill with baking beans. Bake blind for about 15 minutes,
      then remove the beans and foil and cook for a further five minutes to dry out
      the base.\r\nFor the filing, spread the base of the flan generously with raspberry
      jam.\r\nMelt the butter in a pan, take off the heat and then stir in the sugar.
      Add ground almonds, egg and almond extract. Pour into the flan tin and sprinkle
      over the flaked almonds.\r\nBake for about 35 minutes. If the almonds seem to
      be browning too quickly, cover the tart loosely with foil to prevent them burning."

    - Bread and Butter Pudding
    - Dessert
    - British
    - "Grease a 1 litre/2 pint pie dish with butter.\r\nCut the crusts off the bread.
      Spread each slice with on one side with butter, then cut into triangles.\r\nArrange
      a layer of bread, buttered-side up, in the bottom of the dish, then add a layer
      of sultanas. Sprinkle with a little cinnamon, then repeat the layers of bread
      and sultanas, sprinkling with cinnamon, until you have used up all of the bread.
      Finish with a layer of bread, then set aside.\r\nGently warm the milk and cream
      in a pan over a low heat to scalding point. Don't let it boil.\r\nCrack the
      eggs into a bowl, add three quarters of the sugar and lightly whisk until pale.\r\nAdd
      the warm milk and cream mixture and stir well, then strain the custard into
      a bowl.\r\nPour the custard over the prepared bread layers and sprinkle with
      nutmeg and the remaining sugar and leave to stand for 30 minutes.\r\nPreheat
      the oven to 180C/355F/Gas 4.\r\nPlace the dish into the oven and bake for 30-40
      minutes, or until the custard has set and the top is golden-brown."

    - Beef Wellington
    - Beef
    - British
    - "Put the mushrooms into a food processor with some seasoning and pulse to a
      rough paste. Scrape the paste into a pan and cook over a high heat for about
      10 mins, tossing frequently, to cook out the moisture from the mushrooms. Spread
      out on a plate to cool.\r\nHeat in a frying pan and add a little olive oil.
      Season the beef and sear in the hot pan for 30 secs only on each side. (You
      don't want to cook it at this stage, just colour it). Remove the beef from the
      pan and leave to cool, then brush all over with the mustard.\r\nLay a sheet
      of cling film on a work surface and arrange the Parma ham slices on it, in slightly
      overlapping rows. With a palette knife, spread the mushroom paste over the ham,
      then place the seared beef fillet in the middle. Keeping a tight hold of the
      cling film from the edge, neatly roll the Parma ham and mushrooms around the
      beef to form a tight barrel shape. Twist the ends of the cling film to secure.
      Chill for 15-20 minutes to allow the beef to set and keep its shape.\r\nRoll
      out the puff pastry on a floured surface to a large rectangle, the thickness
      of a £1 coin. Remove the cling film from the beef, then lay in the centre. Brush
      the surrounding pastry with egg yolk. Fold the ends over, the wrap the pastry
      around the beef, cutting off any excess. Turn over, so the seam is underneath,
      and place on a baking sheet. Brush over all the pastry with egg and chill for
      about 15 minutes to let the pastry rest.\r\nHeat the oven to 200C, 400F, gas
      6.\r\nLightly score the pastry at 1cm intervals and glaze again with beaten
      egg yolk. Bake for 20 minutes, then lower the oven setting to 180C, 350F, gas
      4 and cook for another 15 mins. Allow to rest for 10-15 minutes before slicing
      and serving with the side dishes of your choice. The beef should still be pink
      in the centre when you serve it."

    - Baingan Bharta
    - Vegetarian
    - Indian
    - "Rinse the baingan (eggplant or aubergine) in water. Pat dry with a kitchen
      napkin. Apply some oil all over and\r\nkeep it for roasting on an open flame.
      You can also grill the baingan or roast in the oven. But then you won't get\r\nthe
      smoky flavor of the baingan. Keep the eggplant turning after a 2 to 3 minutes
      on the flame, so that its evenly\r\ncooked. You could also embed some garlic
      cloves in the baingan and then roast it.\r\n2. Roast the aubergine till its
      completely cooked and tender. With a knife check the doneness. The knife should
      slid\r\neasily in aubergines without any resistance. Remove the baingan and
      immerse in a bowl of water till it cools\r\ndown.\r\n3. You can also do the
      dhungar technique of infusing charcoal smoky flavor in the baingan. This is
      an optional step.\r\nUse natural charcoal for this method. Heat a small piece
      of charcoal on flame till it becomes smoking hot and red.\r\n4. Make small cuts
      on the baingan with a knife. Place the red hot charcoal in the same plate where
      the roasted\r\naubergine is kept. Add a few drops of oil on the charcoal. The
      charcoal would begin to smoke.\r\n5. As soon as smoke begins to release from
      the charcoal, cover the entire plate tightly with a large bowl. Allow the\r\ncharcoal
      smoke to get infused for 1 to 2 minutes. The more you do, the more smoky the
      baingan bharta will\r\nbecome. I just keep for a minute. Alternatively, you
      can also do this dhungar method once the baingan bharta is\r\ncooked, just like
      the way we do for Dal Tadka.\r\n6. Peel the skin from the roasted and smoked
      eggplant.\r\n7. Chop the cooked eggplant finely or you can even mash it.\r\n8.
      In a kadai or pan, heat oil. Then add finely chopped onions and garlic.\r\n9.
      Saute the onions till translucent. Don't brown them.\r\n10. Add chopped green
      chilies and saute for a minute.\r\n11. Add the chopped tomatoes and mix it well.\r\n12.
      Bhuno (saute) the tomatoes till the oil starts separating from the mixture.\r\n13.
      Now add the red chili powder. Stir and mix well.\r\n14. Add the chopped cooked
      baingan.\r\n15. Stir and mix the chopped baingan very well with the onion­tomato
      masala mixture.\r\n16. Season with salt. Stir and saute for some more 4 to 5
      minutes more.\r\n17. Finally stir in the coriander leaves with the baingan bharta
      or garnish it with them. Serve Baingan Bharta with\r\nphulkas, rotis or chapatis.
      It goes well even with bread, toasted or grilled bread and plain rice or jeera
      rice."

    - Beef Brisket Pot Roast
    - Beef
    - American
    - "1 Prepare the brisket for cooking: On one side of the brisket there should
      be a layer of fat, which you want. If there are any large chunks of fat, cut
      them off and discard them. Large pieces of fat will not be able to render out
      completely.\r\nUsing a sharp knife, score the fat in parallel lines, about 3/4-inch
      apart. Slice through the fat, not the beef. Repeat in the opposite direction
      to make a cross-hatch pattern.\r\nSalt the brisket well and let it sit at room
      temperature for 30 minutes.\r\n \r\n2 Sear the brisket: You'll need an oven-proof,
      thick-bottomed pot with a cover, or Dutch oven, that is just wide enough to
      hold the brisket roast with a little room for the onions.\r\nPat the brisket
      dry and place it, fatty side down, into the pot and place it on medium high
      heat. Cook for 5-8 minutes, lightly sizzling, until the fat side is nicely browned.
      (If the roast seems to be cooking too fast, turn the heat down to medium. You
      want a steady sizzle, not a raging sear.)\r\nTurn the brisket over and cook
      for a few minutes more to brown the other side.\r\n\r\n3 Sauté the onions and
      garlic: When the brisket has browned, remove it from the pot and set aside.
      There should be a couple tablespoons of fat rendered in the pot, if not, add
      some olive oil.\r\nAdd the chopped onions and increase the heat to high. Sprinkle
      a little salt on the onions. Sauté, stirring often, until the onions are lightly
      browned, 5-8 minutes. Stir in the garlic and cook 1-2 more minutes.\r\n \r\n4
      Return brisket to pot, add herbs, stock, bring to simmer, cover, cook in oven:
      Preheat the oven to 300°F. Use kitchen twine to tie together the bay leaves,
      rosemary and thyme.\r\nMove the onions and garlic to the sides of the pot and
      nestle the brisket inside. Add the beef stock and the tied-up herbs. Bring the
      stock to a boil on the stovetop.\r\nCover the pot, place the pot in the 300°F
      oven and cook for 3 hours. Carefully flip the brisket every hour so it cooks
      evenly.\r\n \r\n5 Add carrots, continue to cook: After 3 hours, add the carrots.
      Cover the pot and cook for 1 hour more, or until the carrots are cooked through
      and the brisket is falling-apart tender.\r\n6 Remove brisket to cutting board,
      tent with foil: When the brisket is falling-apart tender, take the pot out of
      the oven and remove the brisket to a cutting board. Cover it with foil. Pull
      out and discard the herbs.\r\n7 Make sauce (optional): At this point you have
      two options. You can serve as is, or you can make a sauce with the drippings
      and some of the onions. If you serve as is, skip this step.\r\nTo make a sauce,
      remove the carrots and half of the onions, set aside and cover them with foil.
      Pour the ingredients that are remaining into the pot into a blender, and purée
      until smooth. If you want, add 1 tablespoon of mustard to the mix. Put into
      a small pot and keep warm.\r\n8 Slice the meat across the grain: Notice the
      lines of the muscle fibers of the roast. This is the \"grain\" of the meat.
      Slice the meat perpendicular to these lines, or across the grain (cutting this
      way further tenderizes the meat), in 1/4-inch to 1/2-inch slices.\r\nServe with
      the onions, carrots and gravy. Serve with mashed, roasted or boiled potatoes,
      egg noodles or polenta."

    - "Season the beef cubes with salt and black pepper. Heat a tablespoon of oil
      in the frying pan and fry the meat over a high heat. Do this in three batches
      so that you don’t overcrowd the pan, transferring the meat to a large flameproof
      casserole dish once it is browned all over. Add extra oil if the pan seems dry.\r\nIn
      the same pan, add another tablespoon of oil and cook the shallots for 4-5 minutes,
      then add the garlic and fry for 30 seconds. Add the bacon and fry until slightly
      browned. Transfer the onion and bacon mixture to the casserole dish and add
      the herbs.\r\nPreheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.\r\nPour the stout into the
      frying pan and bring to the boil, stirring to lift any stuck-on browned bits
      from the bottom of the pan. Pour the stout over the beef in the casserole dish
      and add the stock. Cover the casserole and place it in the oven for 1½-2 hours,
      or until the beef is tender and the sauce is reduced.\r\nSkim off any surface
      fat, taste and add salt and pepper if necessary, then stir in the cornflour
      paste. Put the casserole dish on the hob – don’t forget that it will be hot
      – and simmer for 1-2 minutes, stirring, until thickened. Leave to cool.\r\nIncrease
      the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6. To make the pastry, put the flour and salt in a
      very large bowl. Grate the butter and stir it into the flour in three batches.
      Gradually add 325ml/11fl oz cold water – you may not need it all – and stir
      with a round-bladed knife until the mixture just comes together. Knead the pastry
      lightly into a ball on a lightly floured surface and set aside 250g/9oz for
      the pie lid.\r\nRoll the rest of the pastry out until about 2cm/¾in larger than
      the dish you’re using. Line the dish with the pastry then pile in the filling,
      tucking the oysters in as well. Brush the edge of the pastry with beaten egg.\r\nRoll
      the remaining pastry until slightly larger than your dish and gently lift over
      the filling, pressing the edges firmly to seal, then trim with a sharp knife.
      Brush with beaten egg to glaze. Put the dish on a baking tray and bake for 25-30
      minutes, or until the pastry is golden-brown and the filling is bubbling."

    - Blackberry Fool
    - Dessert
    - British
    - "For the biscuits, preheat the oven to 200C/180C (fan)/Gas 6 and line two large
      baking trays with baking parchment. Scatter the nuts over a baking tray and
      roast in the oven for 6-8 minutes, or until golden-brown. Watch them carefully
      so that they don’t have a chance to burn. Remove from the oven, tip onto a board
      and leave to cool.\r\nPut the butter and sugar in a large bowl and beat with
      a wooden spoon until light and creamy. Roughly chop the cooled nuts and add
      to the creamed butter and sugar, along with the lemon zest, flour and baking
      powder. Stir well until the mixture comes together and forms a ball – you may
      need to use your hands.\r\nDivide the biscuit dough into 24 even pieces and
      roll into small balls. Place the balls the prepared baking trays, spaced well
      apart to allow for spreading.\r\nPress the biscuits to flatten to around 1cm/½in
      thick. Bake the biscuits, one tray at a time, for 12 minutes or until very pale
      golden-brown. Leave to cool on the trays. They will be very soft when you take
      them out of the oven, but will crisp as they cool.\r\nStore in an airtight tin
      and eat within five days.\r\nFor the fool, rinse the blackberries in a colander
      to wash away any dust or dirt. Put the blackberries in a non-stick saucepan
      and sprinkle over the caster sugar.\r\nStir in the lemon juice and heat gently
      for two minutes, or until the blackberries begin to soften and release their
      juices. Remove and reserve 12 blackberries for decoration and continue cooking
      the rest.\r\nSimmer the blackberries very gently for 15 minutes, stirring regularly
      until very soft and squidgy. Remove from the heat and press the berries and
      juice through a sieve over a bowl, using the bottom of a ladle to help you extract
      as much of the purée as possible. Leave the purée to cool and discard the seeds.
      You should end up with around 325ml/11fl oz of purée.\r\nPut the cream and yoghurt
      in a large bowl and whip with an electric whisk until soft peaks form when the
      whisk is removed from the bowl – the acidity of the fruit will thicken the cream
      further, so don’t take it too far.\r\nWhen the purée is completely cold, adjust
      the sweetness to taste by adding more sugar if needed. Pour it into the bowl
      with the whipped cream and yoghurt and stir just once or twice until very lightly
      combined.\r\nSpoon the blackberry fool into individual wide, glass dishes –
      or one large, single bowl. It should look quite marbled, so don’t over-stir
      it. Scatter a few tiny mint leaves on top and decorate with the reserved blackberries.
      Sprinkle with a little sugar if you like and serve with the hazelnut biscuits."

      almonds, baking powder, eggs, vanilla and almond extract in a large bowl. Beat
      with an electric whisk until the mix comes together smoothly. Scrape into the
      tin, spreading to the corners, and bake for 25-30 minutes – when you poke in
      a skewer, it should come out clean. Cool in the tin for 10 mins, then transfer
      to a wire rack to finish cooling while you make the second sponge.\r\nFor the
      pink sponge, line the tin as above. Mix all the ingredients together as above,
      but don’t add the almond extract. Fold in some pink food colouring. Then scrape
      it all into the tin and bake as before. Cool.\r\nTo assemble, heat the jam in
      a small pan until runny, then sieve. Barely trim two opposite edges from the
      almond sponge, then well trim a third edge. Roughly measure the height of the
      sponge, then cutting from the well-trimmed edge, use a ruler to help you cut
      4 slices each the same width as the sponge height. Discard or nibble leftover
      sponge. Repeat with pink cake.\r\nTake 2 x almond slices and 2 x pink slices
      and trim so they are all the same length. Roll out one marzipan block on a surface
      lightly dusted with icing sugar to just over 20cm wide, then keep rolling lengthways
      until the marzipan is roughly 0.5cm thick. Brush with apricot jam, then lay
      a pink and an almond slice side by side at one end of the marzipan, brushing
      jam in between to stick sponges, and leaving 4cm clear marzipan at the end.
      Brush more jam on top of the sponges, then sandwich remaining 2 slices on top,
      alternating colours to give a checkerboard effect. Trim the marzipan to the
      length of the cakes.\r\nCarefully lift up the marzipan and smooth over the cake
      with your hands, but leave a small marzipan fold along the bottom edge before
      you stick it to the first side. Trim opposite side to match size of fold, then
      crimp edges using fingers and thumb (or, more simply, press with prongs of fork).
      If you like, mark the 10 slices using the prongs of a fork.\r\nAssemble second
      Battenberg and keep in an airtight box or well wrapped in cling film for up
      to 3 days. Can be frozen for up to a month."

    - Beef Bourguignon
    - Beef
    - French
    - "Heat a large casserole pan and add 1 tbsp goose fat. Season the beef and fry
      until golden brown, about 3-5 mins, then turn over and fry the other side until
      the meat is browned all over, adding more fat if necessary. Do this in 2-3 batches,
      transferring the meat to a colander set over a bowl when browned.\r\nIn the
      same pan, fry the bacon, shallots or pearl onions, mushrooms, garlic and bouquet
      garni until lightly browned. Mix in the tomato purée and cook for a few mins,
      stirring into the mixture. This enriches the bourguignon and makes a great base
      for the stew. Then return the beef and any drained juices to the pan and stir
      through.\r\nPour over the wine and about 100ml water so the meat bobs up from
      the liquid, but isn’t completely covered. Bring to the boil and use a spoon
      to scrape the caramelised cooking juices from the bottom of the pan – this will
      give the stew more flavour.\r\nHeat oven to 150C/fan 130C/gas 2. Make a cartouche:
      tear off a square of foil slightly larger than the casserole, arrange it in
      the pan so it covers the top of the stew and trim away any excess foil. Then
      cook for 3 hrs. If the sauce looks watery, remove the beef and veg with a slotted
      spoon, and set aside. Cook the sauce over a high heat for a few minutes until
      the sauce has thickened a little, then return the beef and vegetables to the
      pan.\r\nTo make the celeriac mash, peel the celeriac and cut into cubes. Heat
      the olive oil in a large frying pan. Tip in the celeriac and fry for 5 minutes
      until it turns golden. Season well with salt and pepper. Stir in the rosemary,
      thyme, bay and cardamom pods, then pour over 200ml water, enough to nearly cover
      the celeriac. Turn the heat to low, partially cover the pan and leave to simmer
      for 25-30 mins.\r\nAfter 25-30 mins, the celeriac should be soft and most of
      the water will have evaporated. Drain away any remaining water, then remove
      the herb sprigs, bay and cardamom pods. Lightly crush with a potato masher,
      then finish with a glug of olive oil and season to taste. Spoon the beef bourguignon
      into serving bowls and place a large spoonful of the celeriac mash on top. Garnish
      with one of the bay leaves, if you like."

    - "Before you do anything, freeze your bacon slices that way when you're ready
      to prep, it'll be so much easier to chop!\r\nWash the potatoes and cut medium
      dice into square pieces. To prevent any browning, place the already cut potatoes
      in a bowl filled with water.\r\nIn the meantime, heat 1-2 tablespoons of oil
      in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Tilt the skillet so the oil spreads
      evenly.\r\nOnce the oil is hot, drain the potatoes and add to the skillet. Season
      with salt, pepper, and Old Bay as needed.\r\nCook for 10 minutes, stirring the
      potatoes often, until brown. If needed, add a tablespoon more of oil.\r\nChop
      up the bacon and add to the potatoes. The bacon will start to render and the
      fat will begin to further cook the potatoes. Toss it up a bit! The bacon will
      take 5-6 minutes to crisp.\r\nOnce the bacon is cooked, reduce the heat to medium-low,
      add the minced garlic and toss. Season once more. Add dried or fresh parsley.
      Control heat as needed.\r\nLet the garlic cook until fragrant, about one minute.\r\nJust
      before serving, drizzle over the maple syrup and toss. Let that cook another

      the chicken will cook in the Enchilada sauce. Make sure you stir occasionally
      so that it doesn't stick to the bottom.\r\nRemove chicken from the pot and shred
      with two forks.\r\nPreheat oven to 375 F degrees.\r\nStart layering the casserole.
      Start with about ¼ cup of the leftover Enchilada sauce over the bottom of a
      baking dish. I used a longer baking dish, so that I can put 2 corn tortillas
      across. Place 2 tortillas on the bottom, top with ⅓ of the chicken and ⅓ of
      the remaining sauce. Sprinkle with ⅓ of the cheese and repeat starting with
      2 more tortillas, then chicken, sauce, cheese. Repeat with last layer with the
      remaining ingredients, tortillas, chicken, sauce and cheese.\r\nBake for 20
      to 30 minutes uncovered, until bubbly and cheese has melted and started to brown
      on top.\r\nServe warm."

    - "Take a large pot or wok, big enough to cook all the chicken, and heat the oil
      in it. Once the oil is hot, add sliced onion and fry them until deep golden
      brown. Then take them out on a plate and set aside.\r\nTo the same pot, add
      the chopped garlic and sauté for a minute. Then add the chopped tomatoes and
      cook until tomatoes turn soft. This would take about 5 minutes.\r\nThen return
      the fried onion to the pot and stir. Add ginger paste and sauté well.\r\nNow
      add the cumin seeds, half of the coriander seeds and chopped green chillies.
      Give them a quick stir.\r\nNext goes in the spices – turmeric powder and red
      chilli powder. Sauté the spices well for couple of minutes.\r\nAdd the chicken
      pieces to the wok, season it with salt to taste and cook the chicken covered
      on medium-low heat until the chicken is almost cooked through. This would take
      about 15 minutes. Slowly sautéing the chicken will enhance the flavor, so do
      not expedite this step by putting it on high heat.\r\nWhen the oil separates
      from the spices, add the beaten yogurt keeping the heat on lowest so that the
      yogurt doesn’t split. Sprinkle the remaining coriander seeds and add half of
      the dried fenugreek leaves. Mix well.\r\nFinally add the cream and give a final
      mix to combine everything well.\r\nSprinkle the remaining kasuri methi and garam

    - 'Heat 1 tablespoon of butter and 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large skillet
      over medium-high heat. Season both sides of each chicken breast with seasoned
      salt and a pinch of pepper. Add the chicken to the skillet and cook for 5-7
      minutes on each side, or until cooked through.  While the chicken is cooking,
      bring a large pot of water to a boil. Season the boiling water with a few generous
      pinches of kosher salt. Add the pasta and give it a stir. Cook, stirring occasionally,
      until al dente, about 12 minutes. Reserve 1/2 cup of  pasta water before draining
      the pasta.  Remove the chicken from the pan and transfer it to a cutting board;
      allow it to rest. Turn the heat down to medium and dd the remaining 1 tablespoon
      of butter and olive oil to the same pan you used to cook the chicken. Add the
      veggies (minus the garlic) and red pepper flakes to the pan and stir to coat
      with the oil and butter (refrain from seasoning with salt until the veggies
      are finished browning). Cook, stirring often, until the veggies are tender,
      about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and a generous pinch of salt and pepper to the
      pan and cook for 1 minute.  Deglaze the pan with the white wine. Continue to
      cook until the wine has reduced by half, about 3 minutes. Stir in the milk,
      heavy cream, and reserved pasta water. Bring the mixture to a gentle boil and
      allow to simmer and reduce for 2-3 minutes. Turn off the heat and add the Parmesan
      cheese and cooked pasta. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Garnish with
      Parmesan cheese and chopped parsley, if desired. '

    - "Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Put the butter in a medium-size saucepan
      and place over a medium heat. Add the onion and leave to cook for 5 mins, stirring
      occasionally. Add the mushrooms to the saucepan with the onions.\r\n\r\nOnce
      the onion and mushrooms are almost cooked, stir in the flour – this will make
      a thick paste called a roux. If you are using a stock cube, crumble the cube
      into the roux now and stir well. Put the roux over a low heat and stir continuously
      for 2 minutes – this will cook the flour and stop the sauce from having a floury
      taste.\r\n\r\nTake the roux off the heat. Slowly add the fresh stock, if using,
      or pour in 500ml water if you’ve used a stock cube, stirring all the time. Once
      all the liquid has been added, season with pepper, a pinch of nutmeg and mustard
      powder. Put the saucepan back onto a medium heat and slowly bring it to the
      boil, stirring all the time. Once the sauce has thickened, place on a very low
      heat. Add the cooked chicken and vegetables to the sauce and stir well. Grease
      a medium-size ovenproof pie dish with a little butter and pour in the chicken
      and mushroom filling.\r\n\r\nCarefully lay the potatoes on top of the hot-pot

      Add the cacao powder first and, as you blend, have all the ingredients to hand
      in order to adjust the ratios slightly as the size of avocados and bananas varies
      so much. The perfect ratio in order to avoid the dish tasting too much of either
      is to use equal amounts of both.\r\n\r\n2. Taste and add a few drops of stevia
      if you feel you need more sweetness.\r\n\r\n3. Fill little cups or shot glasses
      with the mousse, sprinkle with the cacao powder or nibs and serve.\r\n\r\nTip
      If you don’t have a frozen banana to hand you can just use a normal one and
      then chill the mousse before serving for a cooling dessert."

    - "First, make the pastry. Tip the ingredients into a food processor with 1 /4
      tsp salt. Blend until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Drizzle 2-3 tsp cold
      water into the funnel while the blade is running – the mixture should start
      to clump together. Tip onto a work surface and bring together, kneading briefly
      into a ball. Pat into a disc, wrap in cling film, and chill for at least 20
      mins. Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6.\r\n\r\nRemove the pastry from the fridge
      and leave at room temperature for 5 minutes to soften. Flour the work surface,
      then unwrap the pastry and roll to a circle the thickness of a £1 coin. Use
      the pastry to line a deep, 23cm round fluted tin – mine was about 3cm deep.
      Press the pastry into the corners and up the sides, making sure there are no
      gaps. Leave 1cm pastry overhanging (save some of the pastry scraps for later).
      Line with baking parchment (scrunch it up first to make it more pliable) and
      fill with baking beans. Blind-bake for 15-20 minutes until the sides are set,
      then remove the parchment and beans and return to the oven for 5 minutes until
      golden brown. Trim the pastry so it’s flush with the top of the tin – a small
      serrated knife is best for this. If there are any cracks, patch them up with
      the pastry scraps.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, weigh the butter, syrup and sugars into
      a pan, and add 1 /4 tsp salt. Heat until the butter has melted and the sugar
      dissolved, stirring until smooth. Remove from the heat and cool for 10 mins.
      Reduce oven to 160C/140C fan/gas 3.\r\n\r\nBeat the eggs in a bowl. Add the
      syrup mixture, vanilla and pecans, and mix until well combined. Pour half the
      mixture into the tart case, scatter over half the chocolate chips, then cover
      with the remaining filling and chocolate chips. Bake on the middle shelf for
      50-55 minutes until set. Remove from the oven and leave to cool, then chill
      for at least 2 hrs before serving."

      oz of the reserved stock and the wine, if using, stirring until the sauce is
      smooth and thickened slightly. Bring to a gentle simmer and cook for 3 minutes.\r\nSeason
      the mixture, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Remove from
      the heat and stir in the cream. Pour into a large bowl and cover the surface
      of the sauce with cling ilm to prevent a skin forming. Set aside to cool.\r\nPreheat
      the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6. Put a baking tray in the oven to heat.\r\nFor the
      pastry, put the flour and butter in a food processor and blend on the pulse
      setting until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs. With the motor running,
      add the beaten egg and water and blend until the mixture forms a ball. Portion

      floured surface, turning the pastry frequently until around 5mm/¼in thick and
      4cm/1½in larger than the pie dish. Lift the pastry over the rolling pin and
      place it gently into the pie dish. Press the pastry firmly up the sides, making
      sure there are no air bubbles. Leave the excess pastry overhanging the sides.\r\nCut
      the chicken breasts into 3cm/1¼in pieces. Stir the chicken, ham and leeks into
      the cooled sauce. Pour the chicken filling into the pie dish. Brush the rim
      of the dish with beaten egg. Roll out the reserved pastry for the lid.\r\nCover
      the pie with the pastry lid and press the edges together firmly to seal. Trim
      any excess pastry.\r\nMake a small hole in the centre of the pie with the tip
      of a knife. Glaze the top of the pie with beaten egg. Bake on the preheated
      tray in the centre of the oven for 35-40 minutes or until the pie is golden-brown
      all over and the filling is piping hot."

    - "Get everything for the pudding prepared. Chop the almonds coarsely. Peel, core
      and chop the cooking apples. Sharpen your knife and chop the candied peel. (You
      can chop the almonds and apples in a food processor, but the peel must be done
      by hand.) Grate three quarters of the nutmeg (sounds a lot but it's correct).\r\n\r\nMix
      the almonds, apples, candied peel, nutmeg, raisins, flour, breadcrumbs, light
      muscovado sugar, eggs and 2 tbsp brandy or cognac in a large bowl.\L\r\n\r\nHolding
      the butter in its wrapper, grate a quarter of it into the bowl, then stir everything
      together. Repeat until all the butter is grated, then stir for 3-4 minutes –
      the mixture is ready when it subsides slightly after each stir. Ask the family
      to stir too, and get everyone to make a wish.\L\r\n\r\nGenerously butter two
      1.2 litre bowls and put a circle of baking parchment in the bottom of each.
      Pack in the pudding mixture. Cover with a double layer of baking parchment,
      pleating it to allow for expansion, then tie with string (keep the paper in
      place with a rubber band while tying). Trim off any excess paper.\L\r\n\r\nNow
      stand each bowl on a large sheet of foil and bring the edges up over the top,
      then put another sheet of foil over the top and bring it down underneath to
      make a double package (this makes the puddings watertight). Tie with more string,
      and make a handle for easy lifting in and out of the pan. Watch our video to
      see how to tie up a pudding correctly.\r\n\r\nBoil or oven steam the puddings
      for 8 hrs, topping up with water as necessary. Remove from the pans and leave
      to cool overnight. When cold, discard the messy wrappings and re-wrap in new
      baking parchment, foil and string. Store in a cool, dry place until Christmas.\L\r\n\r\nTo
      make the brandy butter, cream the butter with the orange zest and icing sugar.
      Gradually beat in the brandy or cognac and chopped stem ginger. Put in a small
      bowl, fork the top attractively and put in the fridge to set. The butter will
      keep for a week in the fridge, or it can be frozen for up to six weeks.\L\r\n\r\nOn
      Christmas Day, boil or oven steam for 1 hr. Unwrap and turn out. To flame, warm
      3-4 tbsp brandy in a small pan, pour it over the pudding and set light to it."

      pour ½ cup chicken stock or broth over everything. Cover the dish with foil

    - "The day before you want to make the dish, scatter half the salt, half the garlic
      and half of the herbs over the base of a small shallow dish. Lay the duck legs,
      skin-side up, on top, then scatter over the remaining salt, garlic and herbs.
      Cover the duck and refrigerate overnight. This can be done up to 2 days ahead.\r\nPour
      the wine into a saucepan that will snugly fit the duck legs in a single layer.
      Brush the salt off the duck legs and place them, skin-side down, in the wine.
      Cover the pan with a lid and place over a medium heat. As soon as the wine starts
      to bubble, turn the heat down to the lowest setting and cook for 2 hours, checking
      occasionally that the liquid is just barely simmering. (If you own a heat diffuser,
      it would be good to use it here.) After 2 hours, the duck legs should be submerged
      in their own fat and the meat should feel incredibly tender when prodded. Leave
      to cool.\r\nThe duck legs are now cooked and can be eaten immediately – or you
      can follow the next step if you like them crisp. If you are preparing ahead,
      pack the duck legs tightly into a plastic container or jar and pour over the
      fat, but not the liquid at the bottom of the pan. Cover and leave in the fridge
      for up to a month, or freeze for up to 3 months. The liquid you are left with
      makes a tasty gravy, which can be chilled or frozen until needed.\r\nTo reheat
      and crisp up the duck legs, heat oven to 220C/fan 200C/gas 7. Remove the legs
      from the fat and place them, skin-side down, in an ovenproof frying pan. Roast
      for 30-40 mins, turning halfway through, until brown and crisp. Serve with the
      reheated gravy, a crisp salad and some crisp golden ptoatoes."

    - "To make the pastry, dice the butter and put it in the freezer to go really
      hard. Tip flour into the bowl of a food processor with half the butter and pulse
      to the texture of breadcrumbs. Pour in the lemon juice and 100ml iced water,
      and pulse to a dough. Tip in the rest of the butter and pulse a few times until
      the dough is heavily flecked with butter. It is important that you don’t overdo
      this as the flecks of butter are what makes the pastry flaky.\r\nOn a floured
      surface roll the pastry out to a neat rectangle about 20 x 30cm. Fold the two
      ends of the pastry into the middle (See picture 1), then fold in half (pic 2).
      Roll the pastry out again and refold the same way 3 more times resting the pastry
      for at least 15 minutes each time between roll and fold, then leave to rest
      in the fridge for at least 30 minutes before using.\r\nTo make the filling,
      melt the butter in a large saucepan. Take it off the heat and stir in all the
      other ingredients until completely mixed, then set aside.\r\nTo make the cakes,
      roll the pastry out until it’s just a little thicker than a £1 coin and cut
      out 8 rounds about 12cm across. Re-roll the trimming if needed. Place a good
      heaped tablespoon of mixture in the middle of each round, brush the edges of
      the rounds with water, then gather the pastry around the filling and squeeze
      it together (pic 3). Flip them over so the smooth top is upwards and pat them
      into a smooth round. Flatten each round with a rolling pin to an oval until
      the fruit just starts to poke through, then place on a baking tray. Cut 2 little
      slits in each Eccles cakes, brush generously with egg white and sprinkle with
      the sugar (pic 4).\r\nHeat the oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 8. Bake the Eccles
      cakes for 15-20 minutes until just past golden brown and sticky. Leave to cool
      on a rack and enjoy while still warm or cold with a cup of tea. If you prefer,
      Eccles cakes also go really well served with a wedge of hard, tangy British
      cheese such as Lancashire or cheddar."

    - "Heat the flat grill plate over a low heat, on top of 2 rings/flames if it fits,
      and brush sparingly with light olive oil.\r\nCook the sausages first. Add the
      sausages to the hot grill plate/the coolest part if there is one and allow to
      cook slowly for about 15-20 minutes, turning occasionally, until golden. After
      the first 10 minutes, increase the heat to medium before beginning to cook the
      other ingredients. If you are struggling for space, completely cook the sausages
      and keep hot on a plate in the oven.\r\nSnip a few small cuts into the fatty
      edge of the bacon. Place the bacon straight on to the grill plate and fry for
      2-4 minutes each side or until your preferred crispiness is reached. Like the
      sausages, the cooked bacon can be kept hot on a plate in the oven.\r\nFor the
      mushrooms, brush away any dirt using a pastry brush and trim the stalk level
      with the mushroom top. Season with salt and pepper and drizzle over a little
      olive oil. Place stalk-side up on the grill plate and cook for 1-2 minutes before
      turning and cooking for a further 3-4 minutes. Avoid moving the mushrooms too
      much while cooking, as this releases the natural juices, making them soggy.\r\nFor
      the tomatoes, cut the tomatoes across the centre/or in half lengthways if using
      plum tomatoes , and with a small, sharp knife remove the green 'eye'. Season
      with salt and pepper and drizzle with a little olive oil. Place cut-side down
      on the grill plate and cook without moving for 2 minutes. Gently turn over and
      season again. Cook for a further 2-3 minutes until tender but still holding
      their shape.\r\nFor the black pudding, cut the black pudding into 3-4 slices
      and remove the skin. Place on the grill plate and cook for 1½-2 minutes each
      side until slightly crispy.\r\nFor 'proper' fried bread it's best to cook it
      in a separate pan. Ideally, use bread that is a couple of days old. Heat a frying
      pan to a medium heat and cover the base with oil. Add the bread and cook for
      2-3 minutes each side until crispy and golden. If the pan becomes too dry, add
      a little more oil. For a richer flavour, add a knob of butter after you turn
      the slice.\r\nFor the fried eggs, break the egg straight into the pan with the
      fried bread and leave for 30 seconds. Add a good knob of butter and lightly
      splash/baste the egg with the butter when melted. Cook to your preferred stage,
      season and gently remove with a fish slice.\r\nOnce all the ingredients are
      cooked, serve on warm plates and enjoy straight away with a good squeeze of
      tomato ketchup or brown sauce."

      mixture in from the sides of the pan a few times, so it gathers in folds in
      the centre. Leave for a few seconds, then stir again to lightly combine uncooked
      egg with cooked. Leave briefly again, and when partly cooked, stir a bit faster,
      stopping while there’s some barely cooked egg left. With the pan flat on the
      heat, shake it back and forth a few times to settle the mixture. It should slide
      easily in the pan and look soft and moist on top. A quick burst of heat will
      brown the underside.\r\nGrip the handle underneath. Tilt the pan down away from
      you and let the omelette fall to the edge. Fold the side nearest to you over
      by a third with your fork, and keep it rolling over, so the omelette tips onto
      a plate – or fold it in half, if that’s easier. For a neat finish, cover the
      omelette with a piece of kitchen paper and plump it up a bit with your fingers.
      Rub the other knob of butter over to glaze. Serve immediately."

    - Fish Stew with Rouille
    - Seafood
    - French
    - "Twist the heads from the prawns, then peel away the legs and shells, but leave
      the tails intact. Devein each prawn. Fry the shells in 1 tbsp oil for 5 mins,
      until dark pink and golden in patches. Add the wine, boil down by two thirds,
      then pour in the stock. Strain into a jug, discarding the shells.\r\nHeat the
      rest of the oil in a deep frying pan or casserole. Add the fennel, onion and
      garlic, season, then cover and gently cook for 10 minutes until softened. Meanwhile,
      peel the potato and cut into 2cm-ish chunks. Put into a pan of cold water, bring
      to the boil and cook for 5 minutes until almost tender. Drain in a colander.\r\nPeel
      a strip of zest from the orange. Put the zest, star anise, bay and ½ tsp harissa
      into the pan. Fry gently, uncovered, for 5-10 mins, until the vegetables are
      soft, sweet and golden.\r\nStir in the tomato purée, cook for 2 mins, then add
      the tomatoes and stock. Simmer for 10 minutes until the sauce thickens slightly.
      Season to taste. The sauce can be made ahead, then reheated later in the day.
      Meantime, scrub the mussels or clams and pull away any stringy beards. Any that
      are open should be tapped sharply on the worktop – if they don’t close after
      a few seconds, discard them.\r\nReheat the sauce if necessary, then stir the
      potato, chunks of fish and prawns very gently into the stew. Bring back to the
      boil, then cover and gently simmer for 3 mins. Scatter the mussels or clams
      over the stew, then cover and cook for 2 minutes more or until the shells have
      opened wide. Discard any that remain closed. The chunks of fish should flake
      easily and the prawns should be pink through. Scatter with the thyme leaves.\r\nTo
      make the quick rouille, stir the rest of the harissa through the mayonnaise.
      Serve the stew in bowls, topped with spoonfuls of rouille, which will melt into
      the sauce and enrich it. Have some good bread ready, as you’ll definitely want
      to mop up the juices."

    - "Preheat oven to 400ºF (200ºC), and prepare two cookie sheets with parchment
      paper. In a bowl, mix cream cheese, sugar, and vanilla until fully combined.
      Lightly flour the surface and roll out puff pastry on top to flatten. Cut each
      sheet of puff pastry into 9 equal squares. On the top right and bottom left
      of the pastry, cut an L shape approximately ½ inch (1 cm) from the edge.\r\nNOTE:
      This L shape should reach all the way down and across the square, however both
      L shapes should not meet at the ends. Your pastry should look like a picture
      frame with two corners still intact.\r\nTake the upper right corner and fold
      down towards the inner bottom corner. You will now have a diamond shape.\r\nPlace
      1 to 2 teaspoons of the cream cheese filling in the middle, then place berries
      on top.\r\nRepeat with the remaining pastry squares and place them onto the

    - Grilled Mac and Cheese Sandwich
    - Pasta
    - American
    - "Make the mac and cheese\r\n\r\n1. Bring a medium saucepan of generously salted
      water (you want it to taste like seawater) to a boil. Add the pasta and cook,
      stirring occasionally, until al dente, 8 to 10 minutes, or according to the
      package directions. The pasta should be tender but still chewy.\r\n2. While
      the pasta is cooking, in a small bowl, whisk together the flour, mustard powder,
      garlic powder, salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper.\r\n3. Drain the pasta
      in a colander. Place the empty pasta pan (no need to wash it) over low heat
      and add the butter. When the butter has melted, whisk in the flour mixture and
      continue to cook, whisking frequently, until the mixture is beginning to brown
      and has a pleasant, nutty aroma, about 1 minute. Watch carefully so it does
      not scorch on the bottom of the pan.\r\n4. Slowly whisk the milk and cream into
      the flour mixture until everything is really well combined. Cook, whisking constantly,
      until the sauce is heated through and just begins to thicken, about 2 minutes.
      Remove from the heat. Gradually add the cheese while stirring constantly with
      a wooden spoon or silicone spatula and keep stirring until the cheese has melted
      into the sauce. Then stir in the drained cooked pasta.\r\n5. Line a 9-by-13-inch
      (23-by-33-centimeter) rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper or aluminum foil.
      Coat the paper or foil with nonstick cooking spray or slick it with butter.
      Pour the warm mac and cheese onto the prepared baking sheet and spread it evenly
      with a spatula. Coat another piece of parchment paper with cooking spray or
      butter and place it, oiled or buttered side down, directly on the surface of
      the mac and cheese. Refrigerate until cool and firm, about 1 hour.\r\n\r\nMake
      the grilled cheese\r\n6. Heat a large cast-iron or nonstick skillet over medium-low
      heat.\r\n7. In a small bowl, stir together the 4 tablespoons (55 grams) butter
      and garlic powder until well blended.\r\n8. Remove the mac and cheese from the
      refrigerator and peel off the top layer of parchment paper. Carefully cut into
      8 equal pieces. Each piece will make 1 grilled mac and cheese sandwich. (You
      can stash each individual portion in a double layer of resealable plastic bags
      and refrigerate for up to 3 days or freeze it for up to 1 month.)\r\n9. Spread
      3/4 teaspoon garlic butter on one side of each bread slice. Place half of the
      slices, buttered-side down, on a clean cutting board. Top each with one slice
      of Cheddar, then 1 piece of the mac and cheese. (Transfer from the baking sheet
      by scooting your hand or a spatula under each piece of mac and cheese and then
      flipping it over onto a sandwich.) Place 1 slice of Jack on top of each. Finish
      with the remaining bread slices, buttered-side up.\r\n10. Using a wide spatula,
      place as many sandwiches in the pan as will fit without crowding it. Cover and
      cook until the bottoms are nicely browned, about 4 minutes. Turn and cook until
      the second sides are browned, the cheese is melted, and the mac and cheese is
      heated through, about 4 minutes more.\r\n11. Repeat with the remaining ingredients.
      Cut the sandwiches in half, if desired, and serve."

    - "This is one recipe a lot of people have requested and I have tried to make
      it as simple as possible and I hope it will work for you. Make sure you use
      the right flour which is basically one with raising agents. Adjust the amount
      of sugar to your taste and try using different flavours to have variety whenever
      you have them.\r\nYou can use Coconut milk instead of regular milk, you can
      also add desiccated coconut to the dry flour or other spices like powdered cloves
      or cinnamon.\r\nFor “healthy looking” mandazis do not roll the dough too thin
      before frying and use the procedure I have indicated above.\r\n\r\n1. Mix the
      flour,cinnamon and sugar in a suitable bowl.\r\n2. In a separate bowl whisk
      the egg into the milk\r\n3. Make a well at the centre of the flour and add the
      milk and egg mixture and slowly mix to form a dough.\r\n4. Knead the dough for
      3-4 minutes or until it stops sticking to the sides of the bowl and you have
      a smooth surface.\r\n5. Cover the dough with a damp cloth  and allow to rest
      for 15 minutes.\r\n6. Roll the dough on a lightly floured surface into a 1cm
      thick piece.\r\n7. Using a sharp small knife, cut the dough into the desired
      size setting aside ready for deep frying.\r\n8. Heat your oil in a suitable
      pot and gently dip the mandazi pieces to cook until light brown on the first
      side then turn to cook on the second side.\r\n9. Serve them warm or cold"

    - Honey Balsamic Chicken with Crispy Broccoli & Potatoes
    - Chicken
    - American
    - "2 Servings\r\n\r\n1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Wash and dry all produce.
      Cut potatoes into 1/2-inch-thick wedges. Toss on one side of a baking sheet
      with a drizzle of oil, salt, and pepper. (For 4 servings, spread potatoes out
      across entire sheet.) Roast on top rack for 5 minutes (we'll add the broccoli
      then). \r\n\r\n2. Meanwhile, cut broccoli florets into bite-size pieces, if
      necessary. Peel and finely chop garlic. In a small microwave-safe bowl, combine
      1 TBSP olive oil (2 TBSP for 4 servings) and half the garlic. Microwave until
      garlic sizzles, 30 seconds. \r\n\r\n3. Once potatoes have roasted 5 minutes,
      remove sheet from oven and add broccoli to empty side; carefully toss with garlic
      oil, salt, and pepper. (For 4 servings, add broccoli to a second sheet.) Continue
      roasting until potatoes and broccoli are browned and crispy, 15-20 minutes more.
      \r\n\r\n4. While veggies roast, pat chicken dry with paper towels; season all
      over with salt and pepper. Heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high
      heat. Add chicken and cook until browned and cooked through, 5-6 minutes per
      side. (If chicken browns too quickly, reduce heat to medium.) Turn off heat;
      set chicken aside to rest. Wash out pan. \r\n\r\n5. Heat pan used for chicken
      over medium-high heat. Add a drizzle of oil and remaining garlic; cook until
      fragrant, 30 seconds. Stir in vinegar, honey, stock concentrate, and 1/4 cup
      water (1/3 cup for 4 servings). Simmer until thick and glossy, 2-3 minutes.

    - Jam Roly-Poly
    - Dessert
    - British
    - "Put a deep roasting tin onto the bottom shelf of the oven, and make sure that
      there’s another shelf directly above it. Pull the roasting tin out on its shelf,
      fill two-thirds with boiling water from the kettle, then carefully slide it
      back in. Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Tear off a large sheet of foil and
      greaseproof paper (about 30 x 40cm). Sit the greaseproof on top of the foil
      and butter it.\r\nTip butter, flour and vanilla seeds into a food processor;
      pulse until the butter has disappeared. Tip into a mixing bowl. Stir through
      the suet, pour in the milk and work together with a cutlery knife until you
      get a sticky dough. You may need a drop more milk, depending on your flour.\r\nTip
      the dough out onto a floured surface, quickly pat together to smooth, then roll
      out to a square roughly 25 x 25cm. Spread the jam all over, leaving a gap along
      one edge, then roll up from the opposite edge. Pinch the jam-free edge into
      the dough where it meets, and pinch the ends roughly, too. Carefully lift onto
      the greased paper, join-side down (you might find a flat baking sheet helpful
      for this), loosely bring up the paper and foil around it, then scrunch together
      along the edges and ends to seal. The roly-poly will puff quite a bit during
      cooking so don’t wrap it tightly. Lift the parcel directly onto the rack above
      the tin and cook for 1 hr.\r\nLet the pudding sit for 5 minutes before unwrapping,
      then carefully open the foil and paper, and thickly slice to serve."

    - Jerk chicken with rice & peas
    - Chicken
    - Jamaican
    - "To make the jerk marinade, combine all the ingredients in a food processor
      along with 1 tsp salt, and blend to a purée. If you’re having trouble getting
      it to blend, just keep turning off the blender, stirring the mixture, and trying
      again. Eventually it will start to blend up – don’t be tempted to add water,
      as you want a thick paste.\r\n\r\nTaste the jerk mixture for seasoning – it
      should taste pretty salty, but not unpleasantly, puckering salty. You can now
      throw in more chillies if it’s not spicy enough for you. If it tastes too salty
      and sour, try adding in a bit more brown sugar until the mixture tastes well
      balanced.\r\n\r\nMake a few slashes in the chicken thighs and pour the marinade
      over the meat, rubbing it into all the crevices. Cover and leave to marinate
      overnight in the fridge.\r\n\r\nIf you want to barbecue your chicken, get the
      coals burning 1 hr or so before you’re ready to cook. Authentic jerked meats
      are not exactly grilled as we think of grilling, but sort of smoke-grilled.
      To get a more authentic jerk experience, add some wood chips to your barbecue,
      and cook your chicken over slow, indirect heat for 30 mins. To cook in the oven,
      heat to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Put the chicken pieces in a roasting tin with the
      lime halves and cook for 45 minutes until tender and cooked through.\r\n\r\nWhile
      the chicken is cooking, prepare the rice & peas. Rinse the rice in plenty of
      cold water, then tip it into a large saucepan with all the remaining ingredients
      except the kidney beans. Season with salt, add 300ml cold water and set over
      a high heat. Once the rice begins to boil, turn it down to a medium heat, cover
      and cook for 10 mins.\r\n\r\nAdd the beans to the rice, then cover with a lid.
      Leave off the heat for 5 minutes until all the liquid is absorbed. Squeeze the
      roasted lime over the chicken and serve with the rice & peas, and some hot sauce
      if you like it really spicy."

    - "Make the Pastry Dough\r\n\r\nTo a large bowl, add flour, 1 teaspoon salt, and
      turmeric and mix thoroughly.\r\nRub shortening into flour until there are small
      pieces of shortening completely covered with flour.\r\nPour in 1/2 cup of the
      ice water and mix with your hands to bring the dough together. Keep adding ice
      water 2 to 3 tablespoons at a time until the mixture forms a dough.\r\nAt this
      stage, you can cut the dough into 2 large pieces, wrap in plastic and refrigerate
      for 30 minutes before using it.\r\nAlternatively, cut the dough into 10 to 12
      equal pieces, place on a platter or baking sheet, cover securely with plastic
      wrap and let chill for 30 minutes while you make the filling.\r\nMake the Filling\r\n\r\nAdd
      ground beef to a large bowl. Sprinkle in allspice and black pepper. Mix together
      and set aside.\r\nHeat oil in a skillet until hot.\r\nAdd onions and sauté until
      translucent. Add hot pepper, garlic and thyme and continue to sauté for another
      minute. Add 1/4 teaspoon salt.\r\nAdd seasoned ground beef and toss to mix,
      breaking up any clumps, and let cook until the meat is no longer pink.\r\nAdd
      ketchup and more salt to taste.\r\nPour in 2 cups of water and stir. Bring the
      mixture to a boil then reduce heat and let simmer until most of the liquid has
      evaporated and whatever is remaining has reduced to a thick sauce.\r\nFold in
      green onions. Remove from heat and let cool completely.\r\nAssemble the Patties\r\n\r\nBeat
      the egg and water together to make an egg wash. Set aside.\r\nNow you can prepare
      the dough in two ways.\r\nFirst Method: Flour the work surface and rolling pin.
      If you had cut it into 2 large pieces, then take one of the large pieces and
      roll it out into a very large circle. Take a bowl with a wide rim (about 5 inches)
      and cut out three circles.\r\n\r\nPlace about 3 heaping tablespoons of the filling
      onto 1/2 of each circle. Dip a finger into the water and moisten the edges of
      the pastry. Fold over the other half and press to seal. \r\n\r\nTake a fork
      and crimp the edges. Cut off any extra to make it look neat and uniform. Place
      on a parchment-lined baking sheet and continue to work until you have rolled
      all the dough and filled the patties.\r\nSecond Method: If you had pre-cut the
      dough into individual pieces, work with one piece of dough at a time. Roll it
      out on a floured surface into a 5-inch circle or a little larger. Don’t worry
      if the edges are not perfect.\r\n\r\nPlace 3 heaping tablespoons of the filling
      on one side of the circle. Dip a finger into the water and moisten the edges
      of the pastry. Fold over the other half and press to seal.\r\n\r\nTake a fork
      and crimp the edges. Cut off any extra to make it look neat and uniform. Place
      on a parchment-lined baking sheet and continue work until you have rolled all
      the dough and filled the patties.\r\n\r\nFrying and Serving the Patties\r\n\r\nAfter
      forming the patties, place the pans in the refrigerator while you heat the oven
      to 350 F.\r\nJust before adding the pans with the patties to the oven, brush
      the patties with egg wash.\r\nBake patties for 30 minutes or until golden brown.\r\nCool
      on wire racks.\r\nServe warm."

    - "Use pickled vine leaves here, preserved in brine. Small delicate leaves are
      better than the large bristly ones but, if only large leaves are to hand, then
      trim them to roughly 12 by 12 cms so that you don't get too many layers of leaves
      around the filling. And remove any stalks. Drain the preserved leaves, immerse
      them in boiling water for 10 minutes and then leave to dry on a tea towel before
      use. \r\nBasmati rice with butter and pine nuts is an ideal accompaniment. Couscous
      is great, too. Serves four.\r\nFirst make the filling. Put all the ingredients,
      apart from the tomatoes, in a bowl. Cut the tomatoes in half, coarsely grate
      into the bowl and discard the skins. Add half a teaspoon of salt and some black
      pepper, and stir. Leave on the side, or in the fridge, for up to a day. Before
      using, gently squeeze with your hands and drain away any juices that come out.\r\nTo
      make the sauce, heat the oil in a medium pan. Add the ginger and garlic, cook
      for a minute or two, taking care not to burn them, then add the tomato, lemon
      juice and sugar. Season, and simmer for 20 minutes.\r\nWhile the sauce is bubbling
      away, prepare the vine leaves. Use any torn or broken leaves to line the base
      of a wide, heavy saucepan. Trim any leaves from the fennel, cut it vertically
      into 0.5cm-thick slices and spread over the base of the pan to cover completely.\r\nLay
      a prepared vine leaf (see intro) on a work surface, veiny side up. Put two teaspoons
      of filling at the base of the leaf in a 2cm-long by 1cm-wide strip. Fold the
      sides of the leaf over the filling, then roll it tightly from bottom to top,
      in a cigar shape. Place in the pan, seam down, and repeat with the remaining
      leaves, placing them tightly next to each other in lines or circles (in two
      layers if necessary).\r\nPour the sauce over the leaves (and, if needed, add
      water just to cover). Place a plate on top, to weigh the leaves down, then cover
      with a lid. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat and cook on a bare simmer for 70
      minutes. Most of the liquid should evaporate. Remove from the heat, and leave
      to cool a little - they are best served warm. When serving, bring to the table
      in the pan - it looks great. Serve a few vine leaves and fennel slices with
      warm rice. Spoon the braising juices on top and garnish with coriander."

    - "Grind the cashew, poppy seeds and cumin seeds into a smooth paste, using as
      little water as possible. Set aside. \r\n\r\nDeep fry the sliced onions when
      it is hot. Don’t overcrowd the oil. When the onions turn light brown, remove
      from oil and drain on paper towel. The fried onion will crisp up as it drains.
      Also fry the cashewnuts till golden brown. Set aside.\r\n\r\nWash the rice and
      soak in water for twenty minutes.\r\nMeanwhile, take a big wide pan, add oil
      in medium heat, add the sliced onions, add the blended paste, to it add the
      green chillies, ginger garlic paste and garlic and fry for a minute.\r\nThen
      add the tomatoes and sauté them well till they are cooked and not mushy.\r\n\r\nThen
      to it add the red chilli powder, biryani powder, mint, coriander leaves and
      sauté them well.\r\nAdd the yogurt and mix well. I always move the skillet away
      from the heat when adding yogurt which prevents it from curdling.\r\n\r\nNow
      after returning the skillet back to the stove, add the washed lamb and salt
      and ½ cup water and mix well. Cook for 1 hour and cook it covered in medium
      low heat or put it in a pressure cooker for 6 whistles. If the water is not
      drained totally, heat it by keeping it open.\r\n\r\nTake another big pan, add
      thrice the cup of rice you use, and boil it. When it is boiling high, add the
      rice, salt and jeera and mix well. After 7 minutes exact or when the rice is
      80% done. Switch off and drain the rice.\r\n\r\nNow, the layering starts. To
      the lamb, pat and level it. Add the drained hot rice on the top of it. Garnish
      with fried onions, ghee, mint, coriander leaves and saffron dissolved in milk.\r\n\r\nCover
      the dish and bake in a 350f oven for 15 minutes or till the cooked but not mushy.
      Or cook in the stove medium heat for 12 minutes and lowest heat for 5 minutes.
      And switch off. Mix and serve hot!\r\nNotes\r\n1. If you are cooking in oven,
      do make sure to cook in a big oven safe pan and cover it tight and then keep
      in oven for the final step.\r\n2. You can skip biryani masala if you don’t have
      and add just garam masala (1 tsp and red chilli powder – 3 tsp instead of 1
      tsp)\r\n3. If it is spicy in the end, squeeze some lemon, it will reduce the
      heat and enhance the flavors also."

      Blitz ¾ of the chestnuts with 150ml water until creamy. Roughly chop the remaining
      chestnuts.\r\nHeat 2 tbsp olive oil in a large non-stick frying pan. Fry the
      shallots with a pinch of salt until softened, then add the garlic, chopped chestnuts
      and rosemary, and fry for 2 minutes more. Add the wild mushrooms, 2 tbsp oil
      and some seasoning. Cook for 3 minutes until they begin to soften. Drain and
      roughly chop the dried mushrooms (reserve the soaking liquid), then add those
      too, along with the soy sauce, and fry for 2 minutes more.\r\nWhisk the wine,
      reserved mushroom liquid and chestnut cream together to create a sauce. Season,
      then add half to the mushroom mixture in the pan and cook for 1 min until the
      sauce becomes glossy. Remove and discard the rosemary sprigs, then set the mixture
      aside.\r\nHeat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Bring a large pan of salted water
      to the boil and get a large bowl of ice water ready. Drop the lasagne sheets
      into the boiling water for 2 minutes or until pliable and a little cooked, then
      immediately plunge them into the cold water. Using your fingers, carefully separate
      the sheets and transfer to a clean tea towel. Spread a good spoonful of the
      sauce on the bottom two thirds of each sheet, then, rolling away from yourself,
      roll up the shorter ends. Cut each roll in half, then position the rolls of
      pasta cut-side up in a pie dish that you are happy to serve from at the table.
      If you have any mushroom sauce remaining after you’ve rolled up all the sheets,
      simply push it into some of the exposed rolls of pasta.\r\nPour the rest of
      the sauce over the top of the pasta, then bake for 10 minutes or until the pasta
      no longer has any resistance when tested with a skewer.\r\nMeanwhile, put the
      breadcrumbs, the last 2 tbsp olive oil, sage leaves and some seasoning in a
      bowl, and toss everything together. Scatter the rotolo with the crumbs and sage,
      then bake for another 10 mins, until the top is golden and the sage leaves are
      crispy. Leave to cool for 10 minutes to allow the pasta to absorb the sauce,
      then drizzle with a little truffle oil, if you like, before taking your dish
      to the table."

      the pastry, pressing it right up the sides until it pokes just over the top
      of the tin.\r\nAdd the filling into the pastry-lined tin bit by bit. As you
      reach the top, form a slight peak. Roll out the reserved pastry and top the
      pie with it. Pinch the edges to seal and trim the excess. Poke a hole in the
      top of the pie and insert a small tube made from aluminium foil to allow steam
      to escape.\r\nBrush the top of the pie with a little beaten egg yolk, and bake
      in the preheated oven for 30 minutes (put a tray on the shelf below to catch
      any drips). Then reduce the temperature to 160C/325F/Gas 3 and cook for a further

      soured cream (reserve the rest). Whisk to blend, but don't over-beat. The batter
      should be smooth, light and somewhat airy.\r\nBrush the sides of the springform
      tin with melted butter and put on a baking sheet. Pour in the filling - if there
      are any lumps, sink them using a knife - the top should be as smooth as possible.
      Bake for 10 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to fan 90C/conventional 110C/gas
      1⁄4 and bake for 25 minutes more. If you gently shake the tin, the filling should
      have a slight wobble. Turn off the oven and open the oven door for a cheesecake
      that's creamy in the centre, or leave it closed if you prefer a drier texture.
      Let cool in the oven for 2 hours. The cheesecake may get a slight crack on top
      as it cools.\r\nCombine the reserved soured cream with the 142ml carton, the
      sugar and lemon juice for the topping. Spread over the cheesecake right to the
      edges. Cover loosely with foil and refrigerate for at least 8 hours or overnight.\r\nRun
      a round-bladed knife around the sides of the tin to loosen any stuck edges.
      Unlock the side, slide the cheesecake off the bottom of the tin onto a plate,
      then slide the parchment paper out from underneath."

    - "Heat the oven to 300 degrees.\r\nDredging the shanks: pour the flour into a
      shallow dish (a pie plate works nicely). Season the veal shanks on all sides
      with salt and pepper. One at a time, roll the shanks around in the flour coat,
      and shake and pat the shank to remove any excuses flour. Discard the remaining
      flour.\r\nBrowning the shanks: put the oil and 1 tablespoon of the butter in
      a wide Dutch oven or heavy braising pot (6 to 7 quart) and heat over medium-high
      heat. When the butter has melted and the oil is shimmering, lower the shanks
      into the pot, flat side down; if the shanks won’t fit without touching one another,
      do this in batches. Brown the shanks, turning once with tongs, until both flat
      sides are well caramelized, about 5 minutes per side. If the butter-oil mixture
      starts to burn, lower the heat just a bit. Transfer the shanks to a large platter
      or tray and set aside.\r\nThe aromatics: pour off and discard the fat from the
      pot. Wipe out any burnt bits with a damp paper towel, being careful not to remove
      any delicious little caramelized bits. Ad the remaining 2 tablespoons butter
      to the pot and melt it over medium heat. When the butter has stopped foaming,
      add the onion, carrot, celery, and fennel. Season with salt and pepper, stir,
      and cook the vegetables until they begin to soften but do not brown, about 6
      minutes. Stir in the garlic, orange zest, marjoram, and bay leaf, and stew for
      another minute or two.\r\nThe braising liquid: add the wine, increase the heat
      to high, and bring to a boil. Boil, stirring occasionally, to reduce the wine
      by about half, 5 minutes. Add the stock and tomatoes, with their juice, and
      boil again to reduce the liquid to about 1 cup total, about 10 minutes.\r\nThe
      braise: Place the shanks in the pot so that they are sitting with the exposed
      bone facing up, and pour over any juices that accumulated as they sat. Cover
      with parchment paper, pressing down so the parchment nearly touches the veal
      and the edges hang over the sides of the pot by about an inch. Cover tightly
      with the lid, and slide into the lower part of the oven to braise at a gentle
      simmer. Check the pot after the first 15 minutes, and if the liquid is simmering
      too aggressively, lower the oven heat by 10 or 15 degrees. Continue braising,
      turning the shanks and spooning some pan juices over the top after the first
      40 minutes, until the meat is completely tender and pulling away from the bone,
      about 2 hours.\r\nThe gremolata: While the shanks are braising, stir together
      the garlic, parsley, and lemon zest in a small bowl. Cover with plastic wrap
      and set aside in a cool place (or the refrigerator, if your kitchen is very
      warm.)\r\nThe finish: When the veal is fork-tender and falling away from the
      bone, remove the lid and sprinkle over half of the gremolata. Return the veal
      to the oven, uncovered, for another 15 minutes to caramelize it some.\r\nUsing
      a slotted spatula or spoon, carefully lift the shanks from the braising liquid,
      doing your best to keep them intact. The shanks will be very tender and threatening
      to fall into pieces, and the marrow will be wobbly inside the bones, so this
      can be a bit tricky. But if they do break apart, don’t worry, the flavor won’t
      suffer at all. Arrange the shanks on a serving platter or other large plate,
      without stacking, and cover with foil to keep warm.\r\nFinishing the sauce:
      Set the braising pot on top of the stove and evaluate the sauce: if there is
      a visible layer of fat floating on the surface, use a large spoon to skim it
      off and discard it. Taste the sauce for concentration of flavor. If it tastes
      a bit weak or flat, bring it to a boil over high heat, and boil to reduce the
      volume and intensify the flavor for 5 to 10 minutes. Taste again for salt and
      pepper. If the sauce wants more zip, stir in a teaspoon or two of the remaining
      gremolata.\r\nPortioning the veal shanks: if the shanks are reasonably sized,
      serve one per person. If the shanks are gargantuan or you’re dealing with modest
      appetites, pull apart the larger shanks, separating them at their natural seams,
      and serve smaller amounts. Be sure to give the marrow bones to whomever prizes
      them most.\r\nServing: Arrange the veal shanks on warm dinner plates accompanied
      by the risotto, if serving. Just before carrying the plates to the table, sprinkle
      on the remaining gremolata and then spoon over a generous amount of sauce –
      the contact with the hot liquid will aromatize the gremolata and perk up everyone’s
      appetite with the whiff of garlic and lemon."

      more effort and more indulgent than ordinary boiled or roasts, but it doesn''t
      have to take 45mins, it''s nice for a change and you can control the calorie
      content by going with full fat to low fat creme fraiche. (It''s always tastes
      better full fat though obviously!) to serve 4: use 800g of potatoes, finely
      slice and boil in a pan for about 5-8 minutes till firmish, not soft. Finely
      slice 3 onions and place in an oven dish with 2 tblsp of olive oil and 100ml
      of chicken stock. Cook till the onions are soft then drain the potatoes and
      pour onto the onions. Season and spoon over cream or creme fraiche till all
      is covered but not swimming. Grate Parmesan over the top then finish under the
      grill till nicely golden. serve with chicken and bacon, peas and spinach.'

      press the edges of the circle of pastry to thin them out.\r\nWhen the pears
      have cooled slightly, arrange them in the pan, cut side up, in a floral shape,
      with the pears around the edge pointing inwards. Rest the cinnamon stick on
      the top in the centre, with the cardamom pods scattered around.\r\nDrape the
      pastry over the pears, then tuck the edges down the pan sides and under the
      fruit (see Gordon’s guide). Pierce the pastry a few times, then bake for 15
      mins. If a lot of juice bubbles up the side of the pan, pour it off at this
      stage (see guide). Reduce oven to 180C/fan 160C/gas 4 and bake for 15 minutes
      more until the pastry is golden. Leave the tart to stand for 10 mins, then invert
      it carefully onto a serving dish."

    - "Break the eggs into two bowls, five in each. Whisk lightly and season with
      salt and pepper. Heat the oil in a pan, add the courgettes and spring onions,
      then fry gently for about 10 minutes until softened. Cool, then stir into one
      bowl of eggs with a little salt and pepper. Add the roasted peppers to the other
      bowl of eggs with the garlic, chilli, salt and pepper.\r\nHeat a little oil
      in a 20-23cm frying pan, preferably non-stick. Pour the eggs with courgette
      into a measuring jug, then pourabout one-third of the mixture into the pan,
      swirling it to cover the base of the pan. Cook until the egg is set and lightly
      browned underneath, then cover the pan with a plate and invert the omelette
      onto it. Slide it back into the pan to cook the other side. Repeat with the
      remaining mix to make two more omelettes, adding a little oil to the pan each
      time. Stack the omelettes onto a plate. Make three omelettes in the same way
      with the red pepper mixture, then stack them on a separate plate.\r\nNow make
      the filling. Beat the cheese to soften it, then beat in the milk to make a spreadable
      consistency. Stir in the herbs, salt and pepper. Line a deep, 20-23cm round
      cake tin with cling film (use a tin the same size as the frying pan). Select
      the best red pepper omelette and place in the tin, prettiest side down. Spread
      with a thin layer of cheese filling, then cover with a courgette omelette. Repeat,
      alternating the layers, until all the omelettes and filling are in the tin,
      finishing with an omelette. Flip the cling film over the omelette, then chill
      for up to 24 hrs.\r\nTo serve, invert the omelette cake onto a serving plate
      and peel off the cling film. Pile rocket on the top and scatter over the cheese,
      a drizzle of olive oil and a little freshly ground black pepper. Serve cut into
      wedges."

      until golden-brown all over. Transfer the sausages to a plate, then add the
      onion and fennel to the hot pan and fry for 15 minutes, stirring once in a while,
      until soft and caramelised; if the pan goes a bit dry, add a teaspoon or so
      of extra oil. Stir in the paprika, garlic and half the fennel seeds, fry for
      two minutes more, then pour on the wine and boil for 30 seconds, to reduce by
      half. Add the tomatoes, sugar, 100ml water, the seared sausage and half a teaspoon
      of salt, cover and simmer for 30 minutes; remove the lid after 10 minutes, and

    - Vegetarian
    - American
    - "\r\nFor the Lentils: Adjust oven rack to center position and preheat oven to
      450°F to prepare for roasting eggplant. Meanwhile, heat 2 tablespoons olive
      oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat until shimmering. Add carrots, celery,
      and onion and cook, stirring, until softened but not browned, about 4 minutes.
      Add garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add lentils,
      bay leaves, stock or water, and a pinch of salt. Bring to a simmer, cover with
      the lid partially ajar, and cook until lentils are tender, about 30 minutes.
      (Top up with water if lentils are at any point not fully submerged.) Remove
      lid, stir in vinegar, and reduce until lentils are moist but not soupy. Season
      to taste with salt and pepper, cover, and keep warm until ready to serve.\r\n\r\n2.\r\nFor
      the Eggplant: While lentils cook, cut each eggplant in half. Score flesh with
      the tip of a paring knife in a cross-hatch pattern at 1-inch intervals. Transfer
      to a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet, cut side up, and brush each eggplant half
      with 1 tablespoon oil, letting each brushstroke be fully absorbed before brushing
      with more. Season with salt and pepper. Place a rosemary sprig on top of each
      one. Transfer to oven and roast until completely tender and well charred, 25
      to 35 minutes. Remove from oven and discard rosemary.\r\n\r\n3.\r\nTo Serve:
      Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil and pine nuts in a medium skillet set over medium
      heat. Cook, tossing nuts frequently, until golden brown and aromatic, about
      4 minutes. Transfer to a bowl to halt cooking. Stir half of parsley and rosemary
      into lentils and transfer to a serving platter. Arrange eggplant halves on top.
      Spread a few tablespoons of tahini sauce over each eggplant half and sprinkle
      with pine nuts. Sprinkle with remaining parsley and rosemary, drizzle with additional
      olive oil, and serve."

      heat to low and continue to cook and stir until onion is very tender and dark
      brown, about 40 minutes more.\r\nBring chicken broth to a boil in a large pot;
      stir in chicken breasts, reduce heat, and simmer until chicken is no longer
      pink at the center, about 20 minutes. Remove from heat. Remove chicken breasts
      to a plate using a slotted spoon; reserve broth.\r\nJuice potatoes with an electric
      juicer; place dry potato flesh into a bowl and discard juice. Stir salt and
      pepper into potatoes; stir in enough reserved broth to make the mixture the
      consistency of oatmeal. Set remaining broth aside.\r\nSpread half of potato
      mixture evenly into the prepared pan. Lay cooked chicken breast evenly over
      potatoes; scatter caramelized onion evenly over chicken. Spread remaining potato
      mixture over onions and chicken to cover.\r\nBake in the preheated oven until
      golden brown, about 1 hour. Reheat chicken broth; pour over individual servings
      as desired."

    - "Wash and rinse the dried kidney beans.. then cover with water in a deep bowl.
      Remember as they soak they will expand to at least triple the size they were
      originally so add a lot of water to the bowl. Soak them overnight or for at
      least 2 hrs to make the cooking step go quicker. I tossed out the water they
      were soaked in after it did the job.\r\n\r\nHave your butcher cut the salted
      pigtail into 2 inch pieces as it will be very difficult to cut with an ordinary
      kitchen knife. Wash, then place a deep pot with water and bring to a boil. Cook
      for 20 minutes, then drain + rinse and repeat (boil again in water). The goal
      is to make the pieces of pig tails tender and to remove most of the salt it
      was cured in.\r\n\r\nTime to start the soup. Place everything in the pot (except
      the flour and potato), then cover with water and place on a high flame to bring
      to a boil. As it comes to a boil, skim off any scum/froth at the top and discard.
      Reduce the heat to a gentle boil and allow it to cook for 1 hr and 15 mins..
      basically until the beans are tender and start falling apart.\r\n\r\nIt’s now
      time to add the potato (and Yams etc if you’re adding it) as well as the coconut
      milk and continue cooking for 15 minutes.\r\n\r\nNow is a good time to start
      making the basic dough for the spinner dumplings. Mix the flour and water (add
      a pinch of salt if you want) until you have a soft/smooth dough. allow it to
      rest for 5 minutes, then pinch of a tablespoon at a time and roll between your
      hands to form a cigarette shape.\r\n\r\nAdd them to the pot, stir well and continue
      cooking for another 15 minutes on a rolling boil.\r\n\r\nYou’ll notice that
      I didn’t add any salt to the pot as the remaining salt from the salted pigtails
      will be enough to properly season this dish. However you can taste and adjust
      accordingly. Lets recap the timing part of things so you’re not confused. Cook
      the base of the soup for 1 hr and 15 minute or until tender, then add the potatoes
      and cook for 15 minutes, then add the dumplings and cook for a further 15 minutes.
      Keep in mind that this soup will thicken quite a bit as it cools.\r\n\r\nWhile
      this is not a traditional recipe to any one specific island, versions of this
      soup (sometimes called stewed peas) can be found throughout the Caribbean, Latin
      America and Africa. A hearty bowl of this soup will surely give you the sleepies
      (some may call it ethnic fatigue). You can certainly freeze the leftovers and
      heat it up another day."

    - "1 Put the fennel, aubergine, pepper and courgette in a roasting tray. Add a
      glug of olive oil, season with salt and pepper and toss around to coat the veggies
      in the oil. Roast in the oven for 20 minutes, turning a couple of times until
      the veg are pretty much cooked through and turning golden.\r\n\r\n2 Meanwhile,
      heat a paella pan or large frying pan over a low– medium heat and add a glug
      of olive oil. Sauté the onion for 8–10 minutes until softened. Increase the
      heat to medium and stir in the rice, paprika and saffron. Cook for around 1
      minute to start toasting the rice, then add the white wine. Reduce by about
      half before stirring in two-thirds of the stock. Reduce to a simmer and cook
      for 10 minutes without a lid, stirring a couple of times.\r\n\r\n3 Stir in the
      peas, add some seasoning, then gently mix in the roasted veg. Pour over the
      remaining stock, arrange the lemon wedges on top and cover with a lid or some
      aluminium foil. Cook for a further 10 minutes.\r\n\r\n4 To ensure you get the
      classic layer of toasted rice at the bottom of the pan, increase the heat to
      high until you hear a slight crackle. Remove from the heat and sit for 5 minutes
      before sprinkling over the parsley and serving."

    - Smoky Lentil Chili with Squash
    - Vegetarian
    - British
    - "Begin by roasting the squash. Slice it into thin crescents and drizzle with
      a little oil and sprinkle with sea salt. I added a fresh little sage I had in
      the fridge, but it’s unnecessary. Roast the squash a 205 C (400 F) for 20-30
      minutes, flipping halfway through, until soft and golden. Let cool and chop
      into cubes.\r\nMeanwhile, rinse the lentils and cover them with water. Bring
      them to the boil then turn down to a simmer and let cook (uncovered) for 20-30
      minutes, or until tender. Drain and set aside.\r\nWhile the lentils are cooking
      heat the 1 Tbsp. of oil on low in a medium pot. Add the onions and leeks and
      sauté for 5 or so minutes, or until they begin to soften. Add the garlic next
      along with the cumin and coriander, cooking for a few more minutes. Add the
      remaining spices – paprika, cinnamon, chilli, cocoa, Worcestershire sauce, salt,
      and oregano. Next add the can of tomatoes, the water or stock, and carrots.
      Let simmer, covered, for 20 minutes or until the veg is tender and the mixture
      has thickened up. You’ll need to check on the pot periodically for a stir and
      a top of of liquid if needed.\r\nAdd the lentils and chopped roasted squash.
      Let cook for 10 more minutes to heat through.\r\nServe with sliced jalapeno,
      lime wedges, cilantro, green onions, and cashew sour cream.\r\n\r\nSIMPLE CASHEW
      SOUR CREAM\r\n\r\n1 Cup Raw Unsalted Cashews\r\nPinch Sea Salt\r\n1 tsp. Apple
      Cider Vinegar\r\nWater\r\n\r\nBring some water to the boil, and use it to soak
      the cashews for at least four hours. Alternatively, you can use cold water and
      let the cashews soak overnight, but I’m forgetful/lazy, so often use the boil
      method which is much faster.\r\nAfter the cashews have soaked, drain them and
      add to a high speed blender. Begin to puree, slowly adding about 1/2 cup fresh
      water, until a creamy consistency is reached. You may need to add less or more
      water to reach the desired consistency.\r\nAdd a pinch of sea salt and vinegar
      (or lemon juice)."

    - Sticky Toffee Pudding Ultimate
    - Dessert
    - British
    - "Stone and chop the dates quite small, put them in a bowl, then pour the boiling
      water over. Leave for about 30 minutes until cool and well-soaked, then mash
      a bit with a fork. Stir in the vanilla extract. Butter and flour seven mini
      pudding tins (each about 200ml/7fl oz) and sit them on a baking sheet. Heat
      oven to 180C/fan 160C/gas 4.\r\nWhile the dates are soaking, make the puddings.
      Mix the flour and bicarbonate of soda together and beat the eggs in a separate
      bowl. Beat the butter and sugar together in a large bowl for a few minutes until
      slightly creamy (the mixture will be grainy from the sugar). Add the eggs a
      little at a time, beating well between additions. Beat in the black treacle
      then, using a large metal spoon, gently fold in one-third of the flour, then
      half the milk, being careful not to overbeat. Repeat until all the flour and
      milk is used. Stir the soaked dates into the pudding batter. The mix may look
      a little curdled at this point and will be like a soft, thick batter. Spoon
      it evenly between the tins and bake for 20-25 mins, until risen and firm.\r\nMeanwhile,
      put the sugar and butter for the sauce in a medium saucepan with half the cream.
      Bring to the boil over a medium heat, stirring all the time, until the sugar
      has completely dissolved. Stir in the black treacle, turn up the heat slightly
      and let the mixture bubble away for 2-3 minutes until it is a rich toffee colour,
      stirring occasionally to make sure it doesn’t burn. Take the pan off the heat
      and beat in the rest of the cream.\r\nRemove the puddings from the oven. Leave
      in the tins for a few mins, then loosen them well from the sides of the tins
      with a small palette knife before turning them out. You can serve them now with
      the sauce drizzled over, but they’ll be even stickier if left for a day or two
      coated in the sauce. To do this, pour about half the sauce into one or two ovenproof
      serving dishes. Sit the upturned puddings on the sauce, then pour the rest of
      the sauce over them. Cover with a loose tent of foil so that the sauce doesn’t
      smudge (no need to chill).\r\nWhen ready to serve, heat oven to 180C/fan 160C/gas
      4. Warm the puddings through, still covered, for 15-20 minutes or until the
      sauce is bubbling. Serve them on their own, or with cream or custard."

      and press down firmly. Leave to set in the fridge whilst you make the rest!\r\n\r\n2)
      Using an electric mixer, I use my KitchenAid with the whisk attachment, whisk
      together the cream cheese, vanilla, and icing sugar until smooth and then add
      the caramel and whisk again until smooth and lump free – this could take a couple
      of minutes, I whisk it at half speed so not too quick or slow!\r\n\r\n3) Pour
      in the double cream & Salt flakes and continue to whisk for a couple of minutes
      until its very thick and mousse like (I mix it on a medium speed, level 6/10)
      – Now this could take up to 5 minutes depending on your mixer, but you seriously
      have to stick at it – it will hold itself completely when finished mixing (like
      a meringue does!) If you don’t mix it enough it will not set well enough, but
      don’t get impatient and whisk it really quick because that’ll make it split!
      Spread over the biscuit base and leave to set in the fridge overnight.\r\n\r\n4)

    - "Put a large non-stick frying pan on a low heat. Cook the onion slowly in the
      oil and butter until soft but not brown – this should take about 15 mins. Add
      the potatoes, cover the pan and cook for a further 15-20 mins, stirring occasionally
      to make sure they fry evenly.\r\nWhen the potatoes are soft and the onion is
      shiny, crush 2 garlic cloves and stir in, followed by the beaten eggs.\r\nPut
      the lid back on the pan and leave the tortilla to cook gently. After 20 mins,
      the edges and base should be golden, the top set but the middle still a little
      wobbly. To turn it over, slide it onto a plate and put another plate on top,
      turn the whole thing over and slide it back into the pan to finish cooking.
      Once cooked, transfer to a plate and serve the tortilla warm or cold, scattered
      with the chopped parsley.\r\nTo accompany, take slices of warmed baguette, stab
      all over with a fork and rub with the remaining garlic, pile on grated tomatoes

      separate. Put sugar and 3 tbsp water into a large pan. Gently heat until sugar
      dissolves – stir a few times. Bring to a boil for 1 min, then tip in the fruit
      (not strawberries). Cook for 3 minutes over a low heat, stirring 2-3 times.
      The fruit will be softened, mostly intact and surrounded by dark red juice.
      Put a sieve over a bowl and tip in the fruit and juice.\r\nLine the bowl with
      cling film and prepare the bread: Line the 1.25-litre basin with cling film
      as this will help you to turn out the pudding. Overlap two pieces of cling film
      in the middle of the bowl as it’s easier than trying to get one sheet to stick
      to all of the curves. Let the edges overhang by about 15cm. Cut the crusts off
      the bread. Cut 4 pieces of bread in half, a little on an angle, to give 2 lopsided
      rectangles per piece. Cut 2 slices into 4 triangles each and leave the final
      piece whole.\r\nBuild the pud: Dip the whole piece of bread into the juice for
      a few secs just to coat. Push this into the bottom of the basin. Now dip the
      wonky rectangular pieces one at a time and press around the basin’s sides so
      that they fit together neatly, alternately placing wide and narrow ends up.
      If you can’t quite fit the last piece of bread in it doesn’t matter, just trim
      into a triangle, dip in juice and slot in. Now spoon in the softened fruit,
      adding the strawberries here and there as you go.\r\nLet flavours mingle then
      serve: Dip the bread triangles in juice and place on top – trim off overhang
      with scissors. Keep leftover juice for later. Bring cling film up and loosely
      seal. Put a side plate on top and weight down with cans. Chill for 6 hrs or
      overnight. To serve, open out cling film then put a serving plate upside-down
      on top and flip over. serve with leftover juice, any extra berries and cream."

      to a simmer and cook for 1½-2½ hrs, topping up the water as and when you need
      to, to a similar level it started at. As the ham cooks and softens, you can
      halve it if you want, so it is all submerged under the liquid. When the ham
      is tender enough to pull into shreds, it is ready.\r\nLift out the ham, peel
      off and discard the skin. While it is still hot (wear a clean pair of rubber
      gloves), shred the meat. Remove bay from the soup and stir in the frozen peas.
      Simmer for 1 min, then blend until smooth. Add a splash of water if too thick,
      and return to the pan to heat through if it has cooled, or if you are making
      ahead.\r\nWhen you are ready to serve, mix the hot soup with most of the ham
      – gently reheat if made ahead. Serve in bowls with the remaining ham scattered
      on top, and eat with crusty bread and butter."

      pentola con l’acqua salata per cuocere la pasta. Nel frattempo eliminate la
      cotenna dal guanciale  e tagliatelo prima a fette e poi a striscioline spesse
      circa 1cm . La cotenna avanzata potrà essere riutilizzata per insaporire altre
      preparazioni. Versate i pezzetti in una padella antiaderente e rosolate per
      circa 15 minuti a fiamma media, fate attenzione a non bruciarlo altrimenti rilascerà
      un aroma troppo forte.\r\n\r\nNel frattempo tuffate gli spaghetti nell’acqua
      bollente e cuoceteli per il tempo indicato sulla confezione. Intanto versate
      i tuorli in una ciotola, aggiungete anche la maggior parte del pecorino previsto
      dalla ricetta la parte restante servirà per guarnire la pasta.\r\n\r\nInsaporite
      con il pepe nero, amalgamate tutto con una frusta a mano. Aggiungete un cucchiaio
      di acqua di cottura per diluire il composto e mescolate.\r\n\r\n\r\nIntanto
      il guanciale sarà giunto a cottura, spegnete il fuoco e tenetelo da parte. Scolate
      la pasta al dente direttamente nel tegame con il guanciale e saltatela brevemente
      per insaporirla. Togliete dal fuoco e versate il composto di uova e pecorino
      nel tegame, saltate la pasta per amalgamare\r\n\r\n\r\ne se dovesse risultare
      troppo asciutta potete aggiungere poca acqua di cottura. Servite subito gli

    - Soy-Glazed Meatloaves with Wasabi Mashed Potatoes & Roasted Carrots
    - Beef
    - American
    - "1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Wash and dry all produce. Dice potatoes into
      1/2-inch pieces. Trim, peel, and cut carrots on a diagonal into 1/2-inch-thick
      pieces. Trim and thinly slice scallions, separating whites from greens; finely
      chop whites. Peel and finely chop garlic.\r\n\r\n2. In a medium bowl, soak bread
      with 2 TBSP water (4 TBSP for 4 servings); break up with your hands until pasty.
      Stir in beef, sriracha, scallion whites, half the garlic, salt (we used 3/4
      tsp kosher salt; 11/2 tsp for 4), and pepper. Form into two 1-inch-tall loaves
      (four loaves for 4). Place on one side of a baking sheet. Toss carrots on empty
      side of same sheet with a drizzle of oil, salt, and pepper. (For 4, spread meatloaves
      out across whole sheet and add carrots to a second sheet.) Bake for 20 minutes
      (we'll glaze the meatloaves then).\r\n\r\n3. Meanwhile, place potatoes in a
      medium pot with enough salted water to cover by 2 inches. Bring to a boil and
      cook until very\r\ntender, 12-15 minutes. Reserve 1/2 cup potato cooking liquid,
      then drain. While potatoes cook, in a small bowl, combine soy sauce, garlic
      powder, 1/4 cup ketchup (1/2 cup for 4 servings), and 2 tsp sugar (4 tsp for
      4).\r\n\r\n4. Once meatloaves and carrots have baked 20 minutes, remove from
      oven. Spoon half the ketchup glaze over meatloaves (save\r\nthe rest for serving);
      return to oven until carrots are browned and tender, meatloaves are cooked through,
      and glaze is tacky, 4-5 minutes more.\r\n\r\n5. Meanwhile, melt 2 TBSP butter
      (4 TBSP for 4 servings) in pot used for potatoes over medium heat. Add remaining
      garlic and cook\r\nuntil fragrant, 30 seconds. Add potatoes and 1/4 tsp wasabi.
      Mash, adding splashes of reserved potato cooking liquid as necessary until smooth.
      Season with salt and pepper. (If you like things spicy, stir in more wasabi!)\r\n\r\n6.
      Divide meatloaves, mashed potatoes, and roasted carrots between plates. Sprinkle
      with scallion greens and serve with remaining ketchup glaze on the side for
      dipping."

    - Skillet Apple Pork Chops with Roasted Sweet Potatoes & Zucchini
    - Pork
    - American
    - "\r\nServes 2\r\n\r\n\r\n1. \r\n\r\nAdjust racks to top and middle positions
      and preheat oven to 450 degrees. Wash and dry all produce. Dice sweet potatoes
      into 1/2-inch pieces. Toss on a baking sheet with a drizzle of oil, salt, and
      pepper. Roast on top rack for 12 minutes (we'll roast the zucchini then). \r\n\r\n\r\n2.
      \r\n\r\nMeanwhile, halve and core apple; thinly slice into half-moons. Peel
      and finely chop garlic. Quarter lemon. Trim and halve zucchini lengthwise; cut
      crosswise into 1/2-inch-thick half-moons. Toss on a second baking sheet with
      a drizzle of oil and a pinch of salt and pepper. Set aside. \r\n\r\n\r\n3. \r\n\r\nPat
      pork dry with paper towels and season all over with salt and pepper. Heat a
      drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add pork and cook until
      browned and cooked through, 4-5 minutes per side. Turn off heat; transfer to
      a plate. \r\n\r\n\r\n4. \r\n\r\nOnce sweet potatoes have roasted 12 minutes,
      transfer baking sheet with zucchini to middle rack and continue roasting until
      both veggies are browned and softened, 12-15 minutes more. \r\n\r\n\r\n5. \r\n\r\nMeanwhile,
      melt 1 TBSP butter (2 TBSP for 4 servings) in pan used for pork over medium-high
      heat. Add apple and season with salt and pepper. Cook, scraping up any browned
      bits from bottom of pan, until apple is slightly softened, 2-3 minutes. Add
      garlic; cook until fragrant, 30 seconds. Add 1/z cup water (3/4 cup for 4),
      stock concentrate, and 11/2 tsp sugar (3 tsp for 4). Cook, stirring, until sauce
      has thickened and apple is very tender, 3-5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
      \r\n\r\n\r\n6. \r\n\r\nRemove pan with apple from heat; stir in 1 TBSP butter
      (2 TBSP for 4 servings) and a squeeze of lemon juice. Divide pork, zucchini,
      and sweet potatoes between plates. Top pork with glazed apple sauce. Top zucchini
      with a squeeze of lemon juice. "

    - Strawberry Rhubarb Pie
    - Dessert
    - British
    - "Pie Crust:  In a food processor, place the flour, salt, and sugar and process
      until combined. Add the butter and process until the mixture resembles coarse\r\n\r\nmeal
      (about 15 seconds). Pour 1/4 cup (60 ml) water in a slow, steady stream, through
      the feed tube until the dough just holds together when pinched. If necessary,
      add more water. Do not process more than 30 seconds.\r\nTurn the dough onto
      your work surface and gather into a ball. Divide the dough in half, flattening
      each half into a disk, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for about one
      hour before using. This will chill the butter and relax the gluten in the flour.
      \r\n\r\nAfter the dough has chilled sufficiently, remove one portion of the
      dough from the fridge and place it on a lightly floured surface.  Roll the pastry
      into a 12 inch (30 cm) circle. (To prevent the pastry from sticking to the counter
      and to ensure uniform thickness, keep lifting up and turning the pastry a quarter
      turn as you roll (always roll from the center of the pastry outwards).)  Fold
      the dough in half and gently transfer to a 9 inch (23 cm) pie pan. Brush off
      any excess flour and trim any overhanging pastry to an edge of 1/2 inch (1.5
      cm). Refrigerate the pastry, covered with plastic wrap, while you make the filling.
      \r\n\r\nRemove the second round of pastry and roll it into a 13 inch (30 cm)
      circle. Using a pastry wheel or pizza cutter, cut the pastry into about 3/4
      inch (2 cm) strips. Place the strips of pastry on a parchment paper-lined baking
      sheet, cover with plastic wrap, and place in the refrigerator for about 10 minutes.
      \r\n\r\nMake the Strawberry Rhubarb Filling: Place the cut strawberries and
      rhubarb in a large bowl. In a small bowl mix together the cornstarch, sugar,
      and ground cinnamon. \r\n\r\nRemove the chilled pie crust from the fridge. Sprinkle
      about 2 tablespoons of the sugar mixture over the bottom of the pastry crust.
      Add the remaining sugar mixture to the strawberries and rhubarb and gently toss
      to combine. Pour the fruit mixture into the prepared pie shell. Sprinkle the
      fruit with about 1 teaspoon of lemon juice and dot with 2 tablespoons of butter.\r\n\r\nRemove
      the lattice pastry from the refrigerator and, starting at the center with the
      longest strips and working outwards, place half the strips, spacing about 1
      inch (2.5 cm) apart, on top of the filling. (Use the shortest pastry strips
      at the outer edges.) Then, gently fold back, about halfway, every other strip
      of pastry. Take another strip of pastry and place it perpendicular on top of
      the first strips of pastry. Unfold the bottom strips of pastry and then fold
      back the strips that weren't folded back the first time. Lay another strip of
      pastry perpendicular on top of the filling and then continue with the remaining
      strips. Trim the edges of the pastry strips, leaving a 1 inch (2.5 cm) overhang.
      Seal the edges of the pastry strips by folding them under the bottom pastry
      crust and flute the edges of the pastry. Brush the lattice pastry with milk
      and sprinkle with a little sugar. Cover and place in the refrigerator while
      you preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C) and place the oven rack
      in the lower third of the oven. Put a baking sheet, lined with aluminum foil,
      on the oven rack (to catch any spills.)\r\n\r\nPlace the pie plate on the hot
      baking sheet and bake the pie for about 35 minutes and then, if the edges of
      the pie are browning too much, cover with a foil ring. Continue to bake the
      pie for about another 10 minutes or until the crust is a golden brown color
      and the fruit juices begin to bubble.\r\n\r\nRemove the pie from the oven and
      place on a wire rack to cool for several hours. Serve at room temperature with
      softly whipped cream or vanilla ice cream. Leftovers can be stored in the refrigerator
      for about 3 days. Reheat before serving. This pie can be frozen.\r\n\r\nMakes
      one 9 inch (23 cm) pie."

    - "Put the potatoes in a pan of boiling water and cook for 5 minutes. Throw in
      the beans and cook for a further 3 minutes, by which time both should be just
      tender but not too soft. Drain and put to one side.\r\nIn a wok or large frying
      pan, heat the oil until very hot, then drop in the garlic and cook until golden,
      this should take only a few seconds. Don’t let it go very dark or it will spoil
      the taste. Spoon in the curry paste and stir it around for a few seconds to
      begin to cook the spices and release all the flavours. Next, pour in the coconut
      milk and let it come to a bubble.\r\nStir in the fish sauce and sugar, then
      the pieces of chicken. Turn the heat down to a simmer and cook, covered, for
      about 8 minutes until the chicken is cooked.\r\nTip in the potatoes and beans
      and let them warm through in the hot coconut milk, then add a lovely citrussy
      flavour by stirring in the shredded lime leaves (or lime zest). The basil leaves
      go in next, but only leave them briefly on the heat or they will quickly lose
      their brightness. Scatter with the lime garnish and serve immediately with boiled
      rice."

    - Treacle Tart
    - Dessert
    - British
    - "First make the short crust pastry: measure the flour into a large bowl and
      rub in the butter with your fingertips until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs
      (alternatively, this can be done in a food processor). Add about three tablespoons
      of cold water and mix to a firm dough, wrap in cling film and chill in the fridge
      for about 20 minutes.\r\nPreheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6 and put a heavy
      baking tray in the oven to heat up. Grease a deep 18cm/7in loose-bottomed fluted
      flan tin with butter.\r\nRemove about 150g/5½oz of pastry from the main ball
      and set aside for the lattice top.\r\nRoll the rest of the pastry out thinly
      on a lightly floured work surface and line the prepared flan tin with the pastry.\r\nPrick
      the base with a fork, to stop the base rising up during baking.\r\nPlace the
      reserved pastry for the lattice top on cling film and roll out thinly. Egg wash
      the pastry and set aside to chill in the fridge (the cling film makes it easier
      to move about). Do not cut into strips at this stage. Do not egg wash the strips
      once they are on the tart as it will drip into the treacle mixture.\r\nTo make
      the filling, heat the syrup gently in a large pan but do not boil.\r\nOnce melted,
      add the breadcrumbs, lemon juice and zest to the syrup. (You can add less lemon
      if you would prefer less citrus taste.) If the mixture looks runny, add a few
      more breadcrumbs.\r\nPour the syrup mixture into the lined tin and level the
      surface.\r\nRemove the reserved pastry from the fridge and cut into long strips,
      1cm/½in wide. Make sure they are all longer than the edges of the tart tin.\r\nEgg
      wash the edge of the pastry in the tin, and start to make the woven laying lattice
      pattern over the mixture, leave the strips hanging over the edge of the tin.\r\nOnce
      the lattice is in place, use the tin edge to cut off the strips by pressing
      down with your hands, creating a neat finish.\r\nBake on the pre-heated baking
      tray in the hot oven for about 10 minutes until the pastry has started to colour,
      and then reduce the oven temperature to 180C/350F/Gas 4. If at this stage the
      lattice seems to be getting too dark brown, cover the tart with tin foil.\r\nBake
      for a further 25-30 minutes until the pastry is golden-brown and the filling
      set.\r\nRemove the tart from the oven and leave to firm up in the tin. Serve
      warm or cold."

    - "Roll the pastry to a 3mm-thick round on a lightly floured surface and cut a
      24cm circle, using a plate as a guide. Lightly prick all over with a fork, wrap
      in cling film on a baking sheet and freeze while preparing the apples.\r\nHeat
      oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Peel, quarter and core the apples. Put the sugar
      in a flameproof 20cm ceramic Tatin dish or a 20cm ovenproof heavy-based frying
      pan and place over a medium-high heat. Cook the sugar for 5-7 minutes to a dark
      amber caramel syrup that’s starting to smoke, then turn off the heat and stir
      in the 60g diced chilled butter.\r\nTo assemble the Tarte Tatin, arrange the
      apple quarters very tightly in a circle around the edge of the dish first, rounded-side
      down, then fill in the middle in a similar fashion. Gently press with your hands
      to ensure there are no gaps. Brush the fruit with the melted butter.\r\nBake
      in the oven for 30 mins, then remove and place the disc of frozen puff pastry
      on top – it will quickly defrost. Tuck the edges down the inside of the dish
      and, with a knife, prick a few holes in the pastry to allow steam to escape.
      Bake for a further 40-45 minutes until the pastry is golden brown and crisp.\r\nAllow
      to cool to room temperature for 1 hr before running a knife around the edge
      of the dish and inverting it onto a large serving plate that is deep enough
      to contain the juices. Serve with crème fraîche or vanilla ice cream."

    - "Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/ gas 6 and butter 4 small (about 200ml) ramekins.
      Sprinkle the Parmesan into the ramekins, turning until all sides are covered.
      Place the milk and bay leaves in a large saucepan over a gentle heat and bring
      to the boil. Turn off the heat and leave to infuse for 15 mins.\r\nDiscard the
      bay leaves, add the butter and flour, and return to a low heat. Very gently
      simmer, stirring continuously with a balloon whisk, for about 6 minutes until
      you get a smooth, thick white sauce. Make sure that you get right into the corners
      of the pan to stop the sauce from catching or becoming lumpy.\r\nOnce thickened,
      transfer the sauce to a large bowl and stir in the mustard powder, cayenne pepper,
      Gruyère and egg yolks until fully combined.\r\nIn a spotlessly clean bowl and
      with a clean whisk, beat the egg whites just until peaks begin to form.\r\nCarefully
      fold the egg whites into the cheese sauce in three stages making sure you fold,
      rather than stir, to keep the egg whites light and airy. Fill the prepared ramekins
      with the soufflé mix.\r\nTop each soufflé with a slice of goat’s cheese, then
      place on a baking tray. Bake for 20-25 minutes or until springy and well risen
      but cooked through.\r\nLeave to cool, then run a knife around the edge of each
      dish and remove the soufflés. If preparing in advance, place soufflés upside
      down (for neat presentation), on a tray. Cover tray in cling film. Chill for
      a few days or freeze for up to 1 month.\r\nWhen ready to re-bake, heat oven
      to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Place the upside-down soufflés in a shallow baking dish,
      top with the remaining goat’s cheese slices and pour over the cream (this stops
      them from drying out when baked for the second time). Cook for 8-10 minutes
      until golden. Serve immediately alongside some simply dressed salad."

    - Vietnamese Grilled Pork (bun-thit-nuong)
    - Pork
    - Vietnamese
    - "Slice the uncooked pork thinly, about ⅛\". It helps to slightly freeze it (optional).\r\nMince
      garlic and shallots. Mix in a bowl with sugar, fish sauce, thick soy sauce,
      pepper, and oil until sugar dissolves.\r\nMarinate the meat for 1 hour, or overnight
      for better results.\r\nBake the pork at 375F for 10-15 minutes or until about
      80% cooked. Finish cooking by broiling in the oven until a nice golden brown
      color develops, flipping the pieces midway.\r\nAssemble your bowl with veggies,
      noodles, and garnish. Many like to mix the whole bowl up and pour the fish sauce
      on top, but I like to make individual bites and sauce it slowly."

    - "Heat the oil in a large pan. Add the duck legs and brown on all sides for about
      10 mins. Remove to a plate and set aside. Add the onions to the pan and cook
      for 5 minutes until softened. Add the garlic and cook for a further 1 min, then
      stir in the cinnamon and flour and cook for a further min. Return the duck to
      the pan, add the wine, tomatoes, stock, herbs, sugar and seasoning. Bring to
      a simmer, then lower the heat, cover with a lid and cook for 2 hrs, stirring
      every now and then.\r\nCarefully lift the duck legs out of the sauce and place
      on a plate – they will be very tender so try not to lose any of the meat. Pull
      off and discard the fat, then shred the meat with 2 forks and discard the bones.
      Add the meat back to the sauce with the milk and simmer, uncovered, for a further
      10-15 minutes while you cook the pasta.\r\nCook the pasta following pack instructions,
      then drain, reserving a cup of the pasta water, and add the pasta to the ragu.
      Stir to coat all the pasta in the sauce and cook for 1 min more, adding a splash
      of cooking liquid if it looks dry. Serve with grated Parmesan, if you like."

    - Yaki Udon
    - Vegetarian
    - Japanese
    - "Boil some water in a large saucepan. Add 250ml cold water and the udon noodles.
      (As they are so thick, adding cold water helps them to cook a little bit slower
      so the middle cooks through). If using frozen or fresh noodles, cook for 2 minutes
      or until al dente; dried will take longer, about 5-6 mins. Drain and leave in
      the colander.\r\nHeat 1 tbsp of the oil, add the onion and cabbage and sauté
      for 5 minutes until softened. Add the mushrooms and some spring onions, and
      sauté for 1 more min. Pour in the remaining sesame oil and the noodles. If using
      cold noodles, let them heat through before adding the ingredients for the sauce
      – otherwise tip in straight away and keep stir-frying until sticky and piping
      hot. Sprinkle with the remaining spring onions."
